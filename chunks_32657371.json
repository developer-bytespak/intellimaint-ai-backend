This product is not intended to be used in a critical life support application.\nFailure to adhere to this warning could result in death or serious injury.\n\nii Owner\u2019s Manual for 60 Hz Air-Cooled Generators\n\nUse this page to record important information about this generator.\nRecord the information found on the unit data label on this page. See General Information for the location of the unit data label. The unit has a label plate affixed to the inside partition, to the left of the control panel console as shown in Figure 2-1 , Figure 2-2 , or Figure 2-\n3 . See Operation for directions on how to open the top lid and remove the front panel.\nAlways supply the complete model and serial numbers of the unit when contacting an Inde- pendent Authorized Service Dealer (IASD) about parts and service.\nOperation and Maintenance: Correct main- tenance and care of the unit ensures a mini- mum number of problems, and keeps operating expenses at a minimum. It is the operator\u2019s responsibility to perform all safety inspections, to verify all maintenance for safe operation is performed promptly, and to have the equipment inspected periodically by an\nIASD. Normal maintenance, service, and replacement of parts are the responsibility of the owner/operator and are not considered defects in materials or workmanship within the terms of the warranty. Individual operating habits and usage may contribute to the need for additional maintenance or service.\nWhen the generator requires servicing or repairs, Generac recommends contacting an\nIASD for assistance. Authorized service tech- nicians are factory-trained and are capable of handling all service needs.

Flush resulting liquid with water and dry area completely.\n\u2022 DO NOT smoke near battery.\n\u2022 DO NOT cause flame or spark in battery\n\u2022 Discharge static electricity from the body before touching battery by first touching a grounded metal surface.\nBattery should be regularly inspected per\nService Schedule . Contact an IASD for assis- tance if necessary.\n\nInspecting the Battery",
