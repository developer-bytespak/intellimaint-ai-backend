Step 1\n- This guide shows you how to replace your guitar strings and improve your photography skills!\n- The photography setup doesn't have to be fancy. All you need is a camera, tripod, and some carefully-placed lights.\n- Before you start taking your real shots, take some sample pictures to test your lighting.\n![Step 1 Image 6990](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xmFJGebKxDkCSTLL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xmFJGebKxDkCSTLL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xmFJGebKxDkCSTLL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xmFJGebKxDkCSTLL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xmFJGebKxDkCSTLL.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Before you start taking your real shots, take some sample pictures to test your lighting.\n> **Note:** Pay attention to:\n  - How \"white\" your whites are\n  - Shadows and reflections\n  - Under- and overexposure\n- Auto-white-balance sometimes doesn't function properly. If you're indoors, use the tungsten or incandescent (3000K range) setting. If you're outdoors, select daylight (5600K). On some cameras you can also automatically set white balance by taking a picture of a sheet of paper.\n- When you take pictures on a light background, the picture will sometimes appear too dark. To compensate for this, increase the exposure.\n> **Note:** Once you have a lighting setup that you're happy with, leave it the same for the entire shoot.\n![Step 2 Image 6908](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AxgSVavoLkX56iQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AxgSVavoLkX56iQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AxgSVavoLkX56iQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AxgSVavoLkX56iQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AxgSVavoLkX56iQ.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 6909](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MnplsjmcVQOYrLc5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MnplsjmcVQOYrLc5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MnplsjmcVQOYrLc5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MnplsjmcVQOYrLc5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MnplsjmcVQOYrLc5.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 6910](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OlMs6BkOlblQHgNj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OlMs6BkOlblQHgNj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OlMs6BkOlblQHgNj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OlMs6BkOlblQHgNj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OlMs6BkOlblQHgNj.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Find a location that has plenty of light. Don't use a background that's too visually complex.\n- Use two lamps on the object, one on each side.\n- It may be tempting, but don't rotate the camera to take portrait shots. For layout consistency, we require all photos have a landscape 4:3 aspect ratio.\n- Mount the camera to a tripod if you can. Most of today's cameras work great for taking guide pictures. All of the guitar pictures were taken using a [link|http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-S410-Digital-Optical/dp/B0001G6U5M|Canon PowerShot S410].\n- It certainly helps to hook the camera up to your computer after your few initial shots to see how they look on a bigger screen.\n![Step 3 Image 6912](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oqENf6clhPRbODw2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oqENf6clhPRbODw2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oqENf6clhPRbODw2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oqENf6clhPRbODw2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oqENf6clhPRbODw2.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 7077](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y1DXWuW5QmcZ14Bu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y1DXWuW5QmcZ14Bu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y1DXWuW5QmcZ14Bu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y1DXWuW5QmcZ14Bu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y1DXWuW5QmcZ14Bu.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 7125](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6ltGSQRcuEZG3sM2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6ltGSQRcuEZG3sM2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6ltGSQRcuEZG3sM2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6ltGSQRcuEZG3sM2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6ltGSQRcuEZG3sM2.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n> **Note:** Allowing the camera to auto-focus should be fine most of the time. However, in rare circumstances the camera focuses on the background instead of the object you're trying to capture. You can zoom in on the object or move the object away from the background.\n- Many cameras have a close-up or macro mode (often termed the 'flower' setting). Use this mode if your subject is less than 2 feet from the camera.\n- Shoot at the highest resolution possible so you have more flexibility when cropping the shot. We require you upload an image that is at least 800 x 600 pixels.\n- Set your ISO to the lowest possible number (ideally 50-200 ISO). The ISO setting adjusts the camera's sensitivity to light. The higher this setting, the grainier the photo will be.\n![Step 4 Image 7078](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LxKJIMOMAB21M1GN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LxKJIMOMAB21M1GN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LxKJIMOMAB21M1GN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LxKJIMOMAB21M1GN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LxKJIMOMAB21M1GN.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 7079](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ujw5gCasCEkYaWOj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ujw5gCasCEkYaWOj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ujw5gCasCEkYaWOj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ujw5gCasCEkYaWOj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ujw5gCasCEkYaWOj.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Finally, on to the guitar string instructions: Unwind the guitar key.\n- It's important to have your hand in the shot in order to convey the action being performed.\n- This can be difficult. It's easy to get your arm in the shot, or have your hand obstruct what you're trying to show.\n- Fill the frame with the part of the subject pertinent to the step you're describing. When in doubt, go closer - but don't use digital zoom.\n- A lone person can often take all the pictures with a fair amount of dexterity and the help of a tripod. Of course, practice makes perfect!\n- Most cameras have a short (2-10 second) timer option that can free your hands for a shot. This will also eliminate camera shake from pressing the shutter button.\n![Step 5 Image 7080](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2isJTPwgBtOZbj61.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2isJTPwgBtOZbj61.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2isJTPwgBtOZbj61.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2isJTPwgBtOZbj61.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2isJTPwgBtOZbj61.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 7081](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dYRCAnwkylTa1RMV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dYRCAnwkylTa1RMV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dYRCAnwkylTa1RMV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dYRCAnwkylTa1RMV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dYRCAnwkylTa1RMV.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 7083](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QxZdnGpJHAcWIlJW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QxZdnGpJHAcWIlJW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QxZdnGpJHAcWIlJW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QxZdnGpJHAcWIlJW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QxZdnGpJHAcWIlJW.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Remove the bridge pin to free the other side of the string.\n- Sometimes, you need to take the picture slightly differently than you would actually perform the task. Some things are impossible to show the actual action.\n- Removing a bridge pin takes some force wiggling back and forth, which you can't show in a picture. In this case, we removed the pin ahead of time, then put it back for the picture.\n- It's more important to show the 'goal' of the shot than the actual action. In this case, pulling the pin partially out shows the viewer what the complete pin looks like, even though the task is essentially complete by the time the photo is taken.\n- Make sure that your hand (or any other object) does not interfere with the action being performed.\n![Step 6 Image 7093](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NxxdYvoyBV3nbj6I.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NxxdYvoyBV3nbj6I.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NxxdYvoyBV3nbj6I.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NxxdYvoyBV3nbj6I.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NxxdYvoyBV3nbj6I.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 7094](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VE4XqnXlFgD1UfV6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VE4XqnXlFgD1UfV6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VE4XqnXlFgD1UfV6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VE4XqnXlFgD1UfV6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VE4XqnXlFgD1UfV6.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 7096](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hwVAp3Hlc6UXTkpH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hwVAp3Hlc6UXTkpH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hwVAp3Hlc6UXTkpH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hwVAp3Hlc6UXTkpH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hwVAp3Hlc6UXTkpH.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Thread the new guitar string through the bridge pin, and position it along the appropriate string guide.\n- Insert the pin fully into its hole.\n> **Note:** The only time two people are really necessary is when both hands are needed in the shot.\n- You can often get a better angle on the shot if you prop up the object.\n![Step 7 Image 7097](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MctqoToAILktpQuH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MctqoToAILktpQuH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MctqoToAILktpQuH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MctqoToAILktpQuH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MctqoToAILktpQuH.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 7100](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BHPVnSc63ZTMbf2p.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BHPVnSc63ZTMbf2p.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BHPVnSc63ZTMbf2p.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BHPVnSc63ZTMbf2p.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BHPVnSc63ZTMbf2p.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- Insert the other side of the guitar string through the keyhole of the guitar peg.\n- For fine tasks like this, zoom way in the action.\n- Adjust the tripod legs so two legs are much shorter than the third. This allows you to cantilever the camera over the shot to get a more vertical angle.\n- If it's hard to show an action from just one angle, take two or three pictures for the same step.\n![Step 8 Image 7098](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsGS4VPVIUt2PTEM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsGS4VPVIUt2PTEM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsGS4VPVIUt2PTEM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsGS4VPVIUt2PTEM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsGS4VPVIUt2PTEM.full -->\n\n## 9. Step 9\n- Wind the string until it is somewhat tight, and then press it into the fretboard channel.\n- Continue winding until it is close to being tuned.\n![Step 9 Image 7101](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/J5XDWcYBahc2FvAd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/J5XDWcYBahc2FvAd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/J5XDWcYBahc2FvAd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/J5XDWcYBahc2FvAd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/J5XDWcYBahc2FvAd.full -->\n\n## 10. Step 10\n- Use a guitar tuner to check the tune of the string. Adjust accordingly until the string is properly tuned.\n- This picture managed to capture:\n  - A clear representation of the performed action (both person and object)\n  - The end result that's being achieved\n> **Note:** For every picture you take, you have to ask yourself: \"What am I trying to convey with this picture?\"\n![Step 10 Image 7122](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Z1dT5EWqdJMLghXN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Z1dT5EWqdJMLghXN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Z1dT5EWqdJMLghXN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Z1dT5EWqdJMLghXN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Z1dT5EWqdJMLghXN.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# How to Apply Thermal Paste\n\nApplication of thermal paste is essential to keep the processor cool and happy. Follow this general guide to reapply thermal paste after removing a heat sink or CPU during a repair. For more advanced directions, specific to your CPU, check out Arctic Silver's page of [link|http://www.arcticsilver.com/intel_application_method.html#|application methods].\n\nTo apply thermal paste to a phone, [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Apply+Thermal+Paste+to+Phones/157417|follow this guide].\n\n## 1. Overview\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Thermal paste is responsible for conducting heat from the processor to the heat sink. Reassembling a computer without applying thermal paste will cause the processor to overheat, resulting in permanent damage.\n> **Note:** Before applying a new layer of thermal paste, you must first remove any old thermal paste from both the processor surface and the heat sink.\n![Step 1 Image 854666](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JPJfGyl3XRIerIU4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JPJfGyl3XRIerIU4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JPJfGyl3XRIerIU4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JPJfGyl3XRIerIU4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JPJfGyl3XRIerIU4.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Use the flat end of a spudger to scrape off as much solidified thermal paste from the copper core(s) of the heat sink as possible.\n![Step 2 Image 7464](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CoewApRTPTDYnFLl.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CoewApRTPTDYnFLl.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CoewApRTPTDYnFLl.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CoewApRTPTDYnFLl.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CoewApRTPTDYnFLl.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 7465](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZbPTUPJaGQktIDqv.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZbPTUPJaGQktIDqv.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZbPTUPJaGQktIDqv.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZbPTUPJaGQktIDqv.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZbPTUPJaGQktIDqv.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n> **Note:** After scraping off the solidified thermal paste, a residue is still present on the copper core(s).\n![Step 3 Image 7466](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oMmP4lrpTn1fsGvU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oMmP4lrpTn1fsGvU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oMmP4lrpTn1fsGvU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oMmP4lrpTn1fsGvU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oMmP4lrpTn1fsGvU.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Use a coffee filter or a lint-free cloth and a little isopropyl alcohol (a.k.a. IPA, 90% concentration or greater)  to clean the thermal paste residue off the thermal contact surface of your heat sink.\n> **Note:** Instead of IPA, you may also use a dedicated cleaning agent, such as ArctiClean Thermal Material Remover.\n- Once the surface is clean, use a fresh piece of coffee filter or cloth and a little more IPA to remove any oils and prepare the surface.\n- Do not touch either the chip or the heatsink, or allow any dust or debris to get on them. Even a fingerprint can be a major obstacle to thermal transfer on a chip.\n- Allow the heat sink(s) to dry completely!\n![Step 4 Image 7467](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/epsFyUYp1DOjNAMG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/epsFyUYp1DOjNAMG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/epsFyUYp1DOjNAMG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/epsFyUYp1DOjNAMG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/epsFyUYp1DOjNAMG.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 7492](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RLVE56XCkn5M55Mw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RLVE56XCkn5M55Mw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RLVE56XCkn5M55Mw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RLVE56XCkn5M55Mw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RLVE56XCkn5M55Mw.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Use the flat end of a plastic spudger to remove any solidified thermal paste from the surface of the processor(s).\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not use any metal objects for this procedure. Be careful not to break any components on the processor's surface, or get any thermal compound loose on any components (conductive pastes could cause  problems).\n![Step 5 Image 7483](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5bNNPD1mBk2YZHG6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5bNNPD1mBk2YZHG6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5bNNPD1mBk2YZHG6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5bNNPD1mBk2YZHG6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5bNNPD1mBk2YZHG6.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Again, use a coffee filter or lint-free cloth and a little IPA or ArctiClean Thermal Material Remover to clean any thermal paste residue off the processor surface.\n- Use a fresh piece of coffee filter or cloth and some IPA to remove any remaining oils and prepare the surface.\n- Allow the processor(s) to dry completely!\n![Step 6 Image 7484](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UvbFQEffQDWhwhIn.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UvbFQEffQDWhwhIn.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UvbFQEffQDWhwhIn.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UvbFQEffQDWhwhIn.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UvbFQEffQDWhwhIn.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 7493](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tNXJLnRBxsZMX3nu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tNXJLnRBxsZMX3nu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tNXJLnRBxsZMX3nu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tNXJLnRBxsZMX3nu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tNXJLnRBxsZMX3nu.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- To apply new thermal paste, [http://www.arcticsilver.com/methods.html|use the application method recommended for your specific processor type|new_window=true]—vertical line, horizontal line, middle dot, or surface spread. Note that surface spread has the potential to trap air bubbles.\n- If you're using the surface spread method:\n  - Wrap the tip of your index finger with a piece of plastic (such as a sandwich bag or Saran wrap).\n  - Dispense a very small amount of thermal paste onto processor core(s).\n  - Use your finger to gently smear the thermal paste over the entire processor core(s).\n> **Note:** If you accidentally apply a small amount of thermal paste on the green surface of the processor, it will not cause any harm.\n- The processor(s) is now ready for heat sink installation.\n> **Note:** You do not need to apply any thermal paste on the heat sink(s), although [http://www.arcticsilver.com/methods.html|Arctic Silver gives instructions] on \"tinting\" the heat sink to reduce the break-in time of the thermal compound.\n![Step 7 Image 7904](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6uuYpmynrisGkye5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6uuYpmynrisGkye5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6uuYpmynrisGkye5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6uuYpmynrisGkye5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6uuYpmynrisGkye5.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow your device's disassembly instructions in reverse order.",

        "raw_content": "# How To Solder and Desolder Connections\n\nWhile many repairs can be accomplished without soldering, there are times when it's necessary to replace soldered-down components, e.g., joysticks, headphone batteries, and rumble motors. Learning how to solder opens up a new world of fun electronics projects. It may sound intimidating, but it's easy to get started!\n\nThis guide will demonstrate basic soldering skills as well as specific instructions for the following:\n\n* [guide|750|Soldering through-hole components|stepid=4038]\n* [guide|750|Desoldering through-hole components|stepid=4052]\n* [guide|750|Soldering surface mount components|stepid=373590]\n\n## 1. Safety first\n> **Note:** Before you begin soldering, note the following safety precautions:\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Never solder on devices that are powered on or plugged in. Unplug, turn off, and remove power sources before soldering.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Don't solder directly to hard-shell lithium-ion batteries (such as 18650 cells). The heat from the soldering iron will damage the battery internals. Use a battery spot welder instead.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** ***Be extremely careful if you're soldering/desoldering lithium-polymer battery wires!*** You can easily short the battery with solder or your tools, resulting in battery damage and a fire hazard.  Follow these precautions:\n> **Note:** ***Drain the battery below 25%.*** This reduces the battery's ability to start a fire if it was short-circuited.\n> **Note:** ***Work with one wire at a time*** to avoid short circuits. Use tweezers and hold each wire to control its movement and ensure it doesn't short. If you're desoldering a battery from a circuit board, use flush cutters to ***cut each wire one-at-a-time*** to isolate the battery before you desolder the wires.\n> **Note:** Whenever possible, create an indirect path by soldering connectors onto the battery and the circuit board. This reduces the chance of an unintentional short.\n![Step 1 Image 3390871](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJSm5FbPWsCBUaPP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJSm5FbPWsCBUaPP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJSm5FbPWsCBUaPP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJSm5FbPWsCBUaPP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJSm5FbPWsCBUaPP.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 3419537](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3hRHPBMwLEZREkZG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3hRHPBMwLEZREkZG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3hRHPBMwLEZREkZG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3hRHPBMwLEZREkZG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3hRHPBMwLEZREkZG.full -->\n\n## 2. What's through-hole soldering?\n> **Note:** [link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology|Through-hole soldering|new_window=true] refers to threading components with leads ''through holes'' on a circuit board, then securing them with molten solder. Through-hole soldering is prevalent in DIY projects and modern electronics, where it's used to secure large components (such as capacitors and ports).\n> **Note:** Common through-hole components include joystick modules, ports, capacitors, microcontrollers, batteries, and wires.\n![Step 2 Image 3390875](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b1IAYvZaoe2UtLee.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b1IAYvZaoe2UtLee.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b1IAYvZaoe2UtLee.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b1IAYvZaoe2UtLee.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b1IAYvZaoe2UtLee.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 3390876](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jhaQmLQ6qW4WMQNC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jhaQmLQ6qW4WMQNC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jhaQmLQ6qW4WMQNC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jhaQmLQ6qW4WMQNC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jhaQmLQ6qW4WMQNC.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 3390877](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RiQw3pyi4kr2CvcR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RiQw3pyi4kr2CvcR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RiQw3pyi4kr2CvcR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RiQw3pyi4kr2CvcR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RiQw3pyi4kr2CvcR.full -->\n\n## 3. How to solder through-hole components\n> **Note:** The next 10 steps will show you how to solder through-hole components onto a circuit board. In addition to a soldering iron, you'll need:\n  - A vise, clamp, or \"[product|IF145-082|helping hands|new_window=true]\" tool. If you're joining two wires, our [product|IF145-532|Soldering Splint|new_window=true] is a great tool.\n  - A pair of [product|IF145-125|safety glasses|new_window=true] (eyeglasses will protect your eyes, but solder spatter will damage the glasses).\n  - Rosin-core solder wire ([product|IF317-058|leaded|new_window=true] or [product|IF145-077-2|lead-free|new_window=true])\n  - A tip cleaning tool (wet sponge or [product|IF317-032|brass wire|new_window=true])\n  - A [guide|170836|fume extractor|new_window=true] (if you're working indoors)\n  - High concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol and a [product|IF145-062|soft bristle brush|new_window=true] (like a toothbrush)\n  - A [product|IF145-002-2|spudger|new_window=true], [product|IF145-020|tweezers|new_window=true], and [product|IF317-039|flush cutters|new_window=true]\n![Step 3 Image 3419536](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3rKpSlZF54O2EMls.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3rKpSlZF54O2EMls.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3rKpSlZF54O2EMls.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3rKpSlZF54O2EMls.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3rKpSlZF54O2EMls.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 3419535](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IdpoY2CylkG5PkRN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IdpoY2CylkG5PkRN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IdpoY2CylkG5PkRN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IdpoY2CylkG5PkRN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IdpoY2CylkG5PkRN.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- [product|IF145-494|Set up your tools|new_window=true] in a well-lit area, away from anything flammable.\n- Secure the circuit board with a vise or a \"helping hands\" tool. Angle the board such that you can easily access the solder pads.\n- Place the fume extractor close to the project so it'll catch the solder fumes.\n- Wear your safety goggles.\n![Step 4 Image 3419465](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFeWHKdNCJcNLSCZ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFeWHKdNCJcNLSCZ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFeWHKdNCJcNLSCZ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFeWHKdNCJcNLSCZ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFeWHKdNCJcNLSCZ.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 3390884](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YFOOu4wYMInC4E3n.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YFOOu4wYMInC4E3n.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YFOOu4wYMInC4E3n.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YFOOu4wYMInC4E3n.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YFOOu4wYMInC4E3n.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Thread the component leads through the circuit board holes. Most components should lie flat, close to the board.\n> **Note:** ***Double-check the orientation*** if the component is electrically directional (such as diodes, LEDs, and electrolytic capacitors).\n> **Note:** Diodes normally have a bar indicating the cathode (-). LEDs have a shorter lead on the cathode (-) and a flat spot on the dome.\n![Step 5 Image 3390885](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/O1gdcaYufYyf4FeE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/O1gdcaYufYyf4FeE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/O1gdcaYufYyf4FeE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/O1gdcaYufYyf4FeE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/O1gdcaYufYyf4FeE.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 3390886](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GHlBir5foPYPTcoX.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GHlBir5foPYPTcoX.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GHlBir5foPYPTcoX.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GHlBir5foPYPTcoX.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GHlBir5foPYPTcoX.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 3390887](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hy3MOAX1XaXMTDWu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hy3MOAX1XaXMTDWu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hy3MOAX1XaXMTDWu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hy3MOAX1XaXMTDWu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hy3MOAX1XaXMTDWu.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Bend the leads out slightly to help keep the component in place. Alternatively, you can use painter's tape to secure the component.\n![Step 6 Image 3390891](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PcoaUectOKlnaGYI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PcoaUectOKlnaGYI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PcoaUectOKlnaGYI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PcoaUectOKlnaGYI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PcoaUectOKlnaGYI.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 3390892](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SpU64DvIYZoUaIDP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SpU64DvIYZoUaIDP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SpU64DvIYZoUaIDP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SpU64DvIYZoUaIDP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SpU64DvIYZoUaIDP.full -->\n\n## 7. Intermediate Guide\n- Turn on your [product|IF145-495|soldering iron|new_window=true]. If your soldering iron has temperature control:\n  - Set it to 300 °C (~570 °F) if you're using ***leaded solder***\n  - Set it to 375 °C (~700 °F) if you're using ***lead-free solder***\n- Clean the tip of your soldering iron. If you're using a sponge, wet the sponge and quickly wipe the tip across it. If you're using brass wire, stab the tip into the wire a few times.\n![Step 7 Image 3419466](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wQgGfIEMQbQXGXS5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wQgGfIEMQbQXGXS5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wQgGfIEMQbQXGXS5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wQgGfIEMQbQXGXS5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wQgGfIEMQbQXGXS5.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 3442246](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YpCNaRMridmUB1nM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YpCNaRMridmUB1nM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YpCNaRMridmUB1nM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YpCNaRMridmUB1nM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YpCNaRMridmUB1nM.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 3442247](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YjQT3hQSjVtGK1X5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YjQT3hQSjVtGK1X5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YjQT3hQSjVtGK1X5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YjQT3hQSjVtGK1X5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YjQT3hQSjVtGK1X5.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- Melt a small glob of solder onto the tip of the iron. This is called \"tinning the tip\" and will help with heat transfer.\n> **Note:** You'll likely see some wispy smoke as you melt solder. This is mostly the ''rosin-core flux'' that's built into the solder wire. Flux helps molten solder flow, but gets vaporized over time. Once that happens, you'll need to either melt more solder to refresh the flux, or apply flux from an [product|IF317-056|external source|new_window=true].\n> **Note:** If this is your first time using a soldering iron, repeat the cleaning and melting procedure a few times to get a feel at how molten solder handles and how much solder the tip can hold.\n![Step 8 Image 3419476](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UHTMhHXlveK4pRCY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UHTMhHXlveK4pRCY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UHTMhHXlveK4pRCY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UHTMhHXlveK4pRCY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UHTMhHXlveK4pRCY.full -->\n![Step 8 Image 3419477](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WygEZbsNALnbJckg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WygEZbsNALnbJckg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WygEZbsNALnbJckg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WygEZbsNALnbJckg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WygEZbsNALnbJckg.full -->\n![Step 8 Image 3419475](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kyG2b3mdOjSMTVgN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kyG2b3mdOjSMTVgN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kyG2b3mdOjSMTVgN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kyG2b3mdOjSMTVgN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kyG2b3mdOjSMTVgN.full -->\n\n## 9. Step 9\n> **Note:** You're going to heat the solder pad and the component lead ***very hot for 2 to 3 seconds***. The pad and lead should readily melt the solder wire.\n- Press the tip against the circuit board's solder pad and the component lead for about 1 second to heat them both. Angle the tip so it has maximum contact with the pad and lead.\n> **Note:** If you're using a narrow soldering tip or working with a large solder pad, you may not be able to transfer enough heat to the area. You can try increasing the temperature by 50°C or switch to a larger tip for more effective heat transfer.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** If you heat the circuit board continuously for more than 10 seconds, the excessive heat may damage the solder pad or component. Additionally, it could start loosening adjacent components.\n- Feed the solder wire into the heated area until there's a concave pool of solder surrounding the lead.\n> **Note:** This should happen within a few seconds. If the solder doesn't adhere to the pad, apply flux to the pad or increase the temperature.\n> **Note:** Don't feed the solder directly onto the tip as it won't flow properly into the pad and lead causing a weak connection.\n- Remove the solder wire, then remove the soldering iron from the solder pad.\n![Step 9 Image 3419480](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tuv5C5XZiglCHQGP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tuv5C5XZiglCHQGP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tuv5C5XZiglCHQGP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tuv5C5XZiglCHQGP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tuv5C5XZiglCHQGP.full -->\n![Step 9 Image 3419479](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wZvYHqOEaTLH5WRO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wZvYHqOEaTLH5WRO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wZvYHqOEaTLH5WRO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wZvYHqOEaTLH5WRO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wZvYHqOEaTLH5WRO.full -->\n![Step 9 Image 3419478](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SMoXZnUEy2FFbchM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SMoXZnUEy2FFbchM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SMoXZnUEy2FFbchM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SMoXZnUEy2FFbchM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SMoXZnUEy2FFbchM.full -->\n\n## 10. Step 10\n- Congratulations—you've created a solder joint! Inspect the joint to see if it formed correctly:\n  - ***Leaded solder joints*** should look like a shiny, concave tent surrounding the entire lead.\n> **Note:** If the joint isn't shiny, it may not have formed correctly. Reheat the joint briefly and allow it to cool.\n  - ***Lead-free solder joints*** should look like a concave tent surrounding the entire lead. They may be shiny or dull.\n> **Note:** If the solder joint doesn't surround the entire lead, reheat the joint and add more solder.\n> **Note:** If the solder looks like a round bead instead of a concave tent, it didn't bond to the component lead. Reheat the joint and try to get the lead hot enough so the solder bonds to it.\n> **Note:** Check if any solder unintentionally bridged with a different joint. If so, apply some flux and reheat one of the joints to carefully break the bridge. If the bridge doesn't want to separate follow [guide|173873|this step|stepid=370680] and use solder wick to pull away any extra solder.\n> **Note:** Like any skill, practice makes perfect. If your first solder joint doesn't look picture-perfect, that's OK! It takes a few attempts to get the hang of the movement and timing.\n![Step 10 Image 3390906](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWpAGie1SW2oXHLX.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWpAGie1SW2oXHLX.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWpAGie1SW2oXHLX.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWpAGie1SW2oXHLX.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWpAGie1SW2oXHLX.full -->\n![Step 10 Image 3390905](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/g6XXxSQqyeXtkGgl.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/g6XXxSQqyeXtkGgl.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/g6XXxSQqyeXtkGgl.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/g6XXxSQqyeXtkGgl.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/g6XXxSQqyeXtkGgl.full -->\n\n## 11. Clean up your project\n- Once you've finished soldering all of your leads, use a flush cutter to trim the leads right above the solder joint.\n- ***Leave a glob of solder on the tip (tin the tip) before you turn the iron off.*** If you're using rosin-core solder, wait till the tip stops smoking. The solder glob protects the tip from getting dirty or oxidized, increasing its longevity.\n![Step 11 Image 3390908](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EvYTSCO3wpFnuUnY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EvYTSCO3wpFnuUnY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EvYTSCO3wpFnuUnY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EvYTSCO3wpFnuUnY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EvYTSCO3wpFnuUnY.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 3390909](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/koNdtHtIf6rE6xRE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/koNdtHtIf6rE6xRE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/koNdtHtIf6rE6xRE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/koNdtHtIf6rE6xRE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/koNdtHtIf6rE6xRE.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 3390910](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ju6CWLyBZxTWENLr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ju6CWLyBZxTWENLr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ju6CWLyBZxTWENLr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ju6CWLyBZxTWENLr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ju6CWLyBZxTWENLr.full -->\n\n## 12.

Through-hole soldering tips and tricks\n> **Note:** If you're soldering a component with multiple through-hole leads (such as a joystick module, microcontroller, or port), solder two opposite leads to hold the component position in place. Check the alignment, then solder the remaining joints.\n> **Note:** Alternatively, you can bend two opposite leads to secure the component to the board while you solder.\n> **Note:** If the molten solder doesn't flow or is hard to manipulate, apply more flux to the joint.\n![Step 13 Image 3419482](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/44cBSKJNVFmFoROV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/44cBSKJNVFmFoROV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/44cBSKJNVFmFoROV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/44cBSKJNVFmFoROV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/44cBSKJNVFmFoROV.full -->\n![Step 13 Image 3419481](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xQvVUEbKVWJhLvvV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xQvVUEbKVWJhLvvV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xQvVUEbKVWJhLvvV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xQvVUEbKVWJhLvvV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xQvVUEbKVWJhLvvV.full -->\n![Step 13 Image 3390916](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sopKK53NvBNtMKmV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sopKK53NvBNtMKmV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sopKK53NvBNtMKmV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sopKK53NvBNtMKmV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sopKK53NvBNtMKmV.full -->\n\n## 14. How to desolder through-hole components\n> **Note:** The next 8 steps will show you how to desolder through-hole components using a solder wick and desoldering pump.\n> **Note:** If you're new to soldering, be sure to read the soldering steps above first, as this builds upon that knowlege.\n> **Note:** In addition to the soldering equipment, you'll need:\n  - [product|IF317-053|Solder wick|new_window=true] (aka desoldering braid) and/or a [product|IF145-473|desoldering pump|new_window=true].\n  - [product|IF317-056|Flux|new_window=true]\n  - A spudger, tweezers, and/or pliers (to help loosen stubborn components)\n![Step 14 Image 3390917](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PTfa3hW1smJmhG21.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PTfa3hW1smJmhG21.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PTfa3hW1smJmhG21.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PTfa3hW1smJmhG21.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PTfa3hW1smJmhG21.full -->\n\n## 15. Step 15\n- Secure the circuit board with a vise or a \"helping hands\" tool. Angle the board such that you can easily access the solder pads. Wear safety goggles.\n- If possible, use a tip with the largest surface area that can still fit between the solder joint.\n- Turn on your soldering iron. If your soldering iron has temperature control:\n  - Set it to 350 °C (~650 °F) if you're using ***leaded solder***\n  - Set it to 375 °C (~700 °F) if you're using ***lead-free solder***\n![Step 15 Image 3390918](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UYCH6BO4ktCE5iHU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UYCH6BO4ktCE5iHU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UYCH6BO4ktCE5iHU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UYCH6BO4ktCE5iHU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UYCH6BO4ktCE5iHU.full -->\n![Step 15 Image 3390919](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uKIBRPwgAjdvUYpG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uKIBRPwgAjdvUYpG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uKIBRPwgAjdvUYpG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uKIBRPwgAjdvUYpG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uKIBRPwgAjdvUYpG.full -->\n\n## 16. Step 16\n- Clean the tip of your soldering iron. If you're using a sponge, wet the sponge and quickly wipe the tip across it. If you're using brass wire, stab the tip into the wire a few times.\n- Melt a small glob of solder onto the tip. This will help with heat transfer.\n> **Note:** If you're desoldering with a ***solder wick***, proceed to the next step.\n> **Note:** If you're desoldering with a ***desoldering pump***, skip to [guide|173873|this step|stepid=370734].\n![Step 16 Image 3442248](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YoSvBH3C2AhpNYUa.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YoSvBH3C2AhpNYUa.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YoSvBH3C2AhpNYUa.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YoSvBH3C2AhpNYUa.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YoSvBH3C2AhpNYUa.full -->\n![Step 16 Image 3442249](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nyLbhrhbERWZ2Pgy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nyLbhrhbERWZ2Pgy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nyLbhrhbERWZ2Pgy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nyLbhrhbERWZ2Pgy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nyLbhrhbERWZ2Pgy.full -->\n![Step 16 Image 3419485](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UwpWIIyRVNxYlFLk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UwpWIIyRVNxYlFLk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UwpWIIyRVNxYlFLk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UwpWIIyRVNxYlFLk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UwpWIIyRVNxYlFLk.full -->\n\n## 17. How to desolder using a solder wick\n> **Note:** You're going to melt the solder joint ''through the wick'', allowing the wick to draw the molten solder into itself.\n- Apply a bead of [product|IF317-056|flux|new_window=true] to the solder joint.\n- Place a clean portion of the solder wick on top of the solder joint.\n- Press the soldering iron tip firmly against the wick for 2-3 seconds. You're trying to heat the wick hot enough so that it melts the solder underneath it.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** If you heat the circuit board continuously for more than 10 seconds, the excessive heat may damage the solder pad.\n> **Note:** If the wick doesn't draw solder, you may need to increase the temperature. The wick may also be oxidized due to age—apply more flux or try a newer roll of wick.\n- As the solder saturates the wick, slide the wick so that a new portion touches the joint. You'll know it's saturated when the wick's color changes from copper to silver.\n- Once most of the solder has soaked into the wick, lift the wick and tip away together from the joint.\n![Step 17 Image 3390923](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Nfa14DZjyynuBPiV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Nfa14DZjyynuBPiV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Nfa14DZjyynuBPiV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Nfa14DZjyynuBPiV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Nfa14DZjyynuBPiV.full -->\n![Step 17 Image 3419486](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DSXTLXTiXFB2YEaT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DSXTLXTiXFB2YEaT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DSXTLXTiXFB2YEaT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DSXTLXTiXFB2YEaT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DSXTLXTiXFB2YEaT.full -->\n![Step 17 Image 3419487](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RR3BQUHZUNHSKQtt.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RR3BQUHZUNHSKQtt.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RR3BQUHZUNHSKQtt.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RR3BQUHZUNHSKQtt.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RR3BQUHZUNHSKQtt.full -->\n\n## 18.

Through-hole desoldering tips and tricks\n> **Note:** If your desoldering pump doesn't remove all the solder and you're having trouble heating the joint, apply some more solder and try again.\n> **Note:** If you're still having trouble melting the solder, apply some [product|IF317-061|low‑temp solder|new_window=true] to the joint to keep it liquid for longer.\n> **Note:** Clean your soldering iron before use to avoid brittle joints from mixing low‑temp solder with standard solder.\n> **Note:** Are you desoldering a lot of pins? Or do you just desolder a lot? A dedicated desoldering station or [product|IF317-010|gun|new_window=true] is a worthwhile investment.\n![Step 22 Image 3419505](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FwZI442iPc1Hg5Vf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FwZI442iPc1Hg5Vf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FwZI442iPc1Hg5Vf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FwZI442iPc1Hg5Vf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FwZI442iPc1Hg5Vf.full -->\n![Step 22 Image 3419504](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MqjhFYGUdxFVmDqa.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MqjhFYGUdxFVmDqa.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MqjhFYGUdxFVmDqa.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MqjhFYGUdxFVmDqa.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MqjhFYGUdxFVmDqa.full -->\n\n## 23. What's surface-mount soldering?\n> **Note:** [link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology|Surface-mount soldering|new_window=true] is a process where components are soldered onto the surface of the circuit board. Most electronics manufacturers use surface-mount technology (SMT) because it can be automated and is more cost-effective.\n> **Note:** In industrial manufacturing, a machine uses a stencil to lay down solder paste onto the circuit board. Robotic arms precisely [link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-and-place_machine|pick and place|new_window=true] each component onto the board. The board passes through an oven, where the solder paste melts and solders the components to the board.\n> **Note:** Surface mount components are significantly smaller than through-hole components, making them difficult to solder by hand. But with a bit of patience, practice, and a good magnifying glass, you can become proficient in surface-mount soldering!\n![Step 23 Image 3390938](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uLTEBIRVEuYFXVM1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uLTEBIRVEuYFXVM1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uLTEBIRVEuYFXVM1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uLTEBIRVEuYFXVM1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uLTEBIRVEuYFXVM1.full -->\n![Step 23 Image 3390939](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1HTHk15jnK6JHY3e.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1HTHk15jnK6JHY3e.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1HTHk15jnK6JHY3e.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1HTHk15jnK6JHY3e.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1HTHk15jnK6JHY3e.full -->\n![Step 23 Image 3390940](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vHafmh1OK2A53oUs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vHafmh1OK2A53oUs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vHafmh1OK2A53oUs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vHafmh1OK2A53oUs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vHafmh1OK2A53oUs.full -->\n\n## 24. How to solder surface-mount components\n- The next 6 steps will show you how to solder surface-mount components onto a circuit board. You'll need a fine-tipped soldering iron in addition to the following:\n  - Solder wire ([product|IF317-058|leaded|new_window=true] or [product|IF145-077-2|lead-free|new_window=true]) or solder paste\n  - [product|IF317-056|Flux|new_window=true]\n  - [product|IF317-047|Tweezers|new_window=true] and [product|IF145-059|picks|new_window=true] to help manipulate the tiny components\n  - A tip cleaning tool (wet sponge or [product|IF317-032|brass wire|new_window=true])\n  - A magnifying glass or lens\n  - A [guide|170836|fume extractor|new_window=true] (if you're working indoors)\n  - High concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol and a [product|IF145-062|soft bristle brush|new_window=true] (like a toothbrush)\n![Step 24 Image 3419526](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I5cnWfTCPlvAYaiE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I5cnWfTCPlvAYaiE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I5cnWfTCPlvAYaiE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I5cnWfTCPlvAYaiE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I5cnWfTCPlvAYaiE.full -->\n![Step 24 Image 3419528](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uUeKEupsu5xEQ5uA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uUeKEupsu5xEQ5uA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uUeKEupsu5xEQ5uA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uUeKEupsu5xEQ5uA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uUeKEupsu5xEQ5uA.full -->\n\n## 25. Step 25\n- Set up your tools in a well-lit area, away from anything flammable.\n- Set the circuit board on a flat, non-flammable, heat-resistant surface or secure it with helping hands or a [product|IF317-033|PCB vise|new_window=true].\n- Place the fume extractor close to the project so that it'll catch the solder fumes.\n- Wear your safety goggles.\n![Step 25 Image 3419506](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hCUgWtpQhqVyMCGy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hCUgWtpQhqVyMCGy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hCUgWtpQhqVyMCGy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hCUgWtpQhqVyMCGy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hCUgWtpQhqVyMCGy.full -->\n![Step 25 Image 3390944](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgHm6b5ZyUg3rXjK.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgHm6b5ZyUg3rXjK.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgHm6b5ZyUg3rXjK.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgHm6b5ZyUg3rXjK.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgHm6b5ZyUg3rXjK.full -->\n\n## 26. Step 26\n- Apply a small bead of flux onto each solder pad.\n> **Note:** If you're using solder paste, apply a small amount of paste instead. Most solder pastes contain flux.\n- Use tweezers and picks to carefully maneuver your component so that it straddles between the solder pads.\n> **Note:** This can be very tricky depending on the size of your component! Take your time and don't press against the component too hard, or you may fling it out of place.\n> **Note:** ***Double-check the component orientation*** if it's electrically directional (such as LEDs and diodes). These components normally have a bar indicating the cathode (-) end.\n![Step 26 Image 3390945](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iHmbwEqL6lq3uIiO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iHmbwEqL6lq3uIiO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iHmbwEqL6lq3uIiO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iHmbwEqL6lq3uIiO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iHmbwEqL6lq3uIiO.full -->\n![Step 26 Image 3390946](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MeHCAJQeyUcrQVIp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MeHCAJQeyUcrQVIp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MeHCAJQeyUcrQVIp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MeHCAJQeyUcrQVIp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MeHCAJQeyUcrQVIp.full -->\n![Step 26 Image 3390947](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ta1wjSBZtNk6mAPD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ta1wjSBZtNk6mAPD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ta1wjSBZtNk6mAPD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ta1wjSBZtNk6mAPD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ta1wjSBZtNk6mAPD.full -->\n\n## 27. Step 27\n- Turn on your soldering iron. If your soldering iron has temperature control:\n  - Set it to 350 °C (~650 °F) if you're using ***leaded solder***\n  - Set it to 400 °C (~750 °F) if you're using ***lead-free solder***\n- Clean the tip of your soldering iron. If you're using a sponge, wet the sponge and quickly wipe the tip across it. If you're using brass wire, stab the tip into the wire a few times.\n- If you're ''not'' using solder paste, melt a small amount of solder onto the tip. You'll transfer this solder onto the joint.\n![Step 27 Image 3419507](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hVBy6Nkcd3BgcJrt.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hVBy6Nkcd3BgcJrt.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hVBy6Nkcd3BgcJrt.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hVBy6Nkcd3BgcJrt.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hVBy6Nkcd3BgcJrt.full -->\n![Step 27 Image 3442255](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kxwFFx6NeTECKtFg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kxwFFx6NeTECKtFg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kxwFFx6NeTECKtFg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kxwFFx6NeTECKtFg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kxwFFx6NeTECKtFg.full -->\n![Step 27 Image 3419509](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dKcekFiDW14Vok5u.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dKcekFiDW14Vok5u.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dKcekFiDW14Vok5u.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dKcekFiDW14Vok5u.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dKcekFiDW14Vok5u.full -->\n\n## 28. Step 28\n- Carefully press a tweezer point or the tip of a spudger on top of the component to hold it in place.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** The soldering iron will spill a lot of heat around the point of contact, which can easily loosen surrounding components. Be careful not to bump the surrounding parts with your tools.\n- Touch the soldering iron tip to the solder pad and the component. Once the pad heats up, it will draw the molten solder onto itself.\n> **Note:** This should happen within a few seconds. If the solder doesn't adhere to the pad, apply more flux to the pad or increase the temperature.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Don't heat continuously more than 10 seconds at a time, or the heat may damage the component and solder pad. Allow the circuit board to cool down, then try again.\n- Remove the tip from the solder joint.\n- Repeat this process for the rest of the component leads.\n![Step 28 Image 3419512](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wD6CFSCHv4jJCIhk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wD6CFSCHv4jJCIhk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wD6CFSCHv4jJCIhk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wD6CFSCHv4jJCIhk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wD6CFSCHv4jJCIhk.full -->\n![Step 28 Image 3419511](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rN3GpIkXansVETME.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rN3GpIkXansVETME.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rN3GpIkXansVETME.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rN3GpIkXansVETME.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rN3GpIkXansVETME.full -->\n![Step 28 Image 3419510](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/btoJ55GmZWBcXhXT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/btoJ55GmZWBcXhXT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/btoJ55GmZWBcXhXT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/btoJ55GmZWBcXhXT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/btoJ55GmZWBcXhXT.full -->\n\n## 29. How to clean\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Be gentle when you're cleaning small components as they can easily break off the board.\n- Apply some isopropyl alcohol to the solder joints and scrub the area with a soft bristled brush to remove any flux residue.\n- Wipe the solder joint with a lint-free cloth to soak up the flux and alcohol residue.\n![Step 29 Image 3390954](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2xFaXVAM3O4rtjpw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2xFaXVAM3O4rtjpw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2xFaXVAM3O4rtjpw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2xFaXVAM3O4rtjpw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2xFaXVAM3O4rtjpw.full -->\n![Step 29 Image 3390955](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Th2eQuNgeR2tWb6W.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Th2eQuNgeR2tWb6W.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Th2eQuNgeR2tWb6W.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Th2eQuNgeR2tWb6W.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Th2eQuNgeR2tWb6W.full -->\n![Step 29 Image 3390956](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/j4I1N1G5wLkbGMDB.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/j4I1N1G5wLkbGMDB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/j4I1N1G5wLkbGMDB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/j4I1N1G5wLkbGMDB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/j4I1N1G5wLkbGMDB.full -->\n\n## 30. Surface mount tips and tricks\n> **Note:** Many surface mount components (especially integrated circuits) have multiple leads that need to be soldered. They can be difficult to align and secure to the board:\n  - Hold the component in place and solder the corner leads to secure it in place.\n  - Alternatively, you can secure the component to the board using [product|IF145-113|polyimide tape|new_window=true] and then solder the corner leads.\n![Step 30 Image 3419513](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jvhBQCwqybnvMWgb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jvhBQCwqybnvMWgb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jvhBQCwqybnvMWgb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jvhBQCwqybnvMWgb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jvhBQCwqybnvMWgb.full -->\n![Step 30 Image 3419514](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YopteTeCYMRLgPls.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YopteTeCYMRLgPls.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YopteTeCYMRLgPls.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YopteTeCYMRLgPls.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YopteTeCYMRLgPls.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongratulations on completing this introductory soldering guide!

        "raw_content": "# How to Install macOS High Sierra\n\n***Note***: If you’re trying to install the latest MacOS on a 2009 and later Apple computer, follow the [guide|119499|MacOS internet recovery guide instead].\n\nIf you have recently upgraded or replaced the hard drive for your MacBook or iMac, you will need to reinstall macOS onto it. This guide will show you how to install macOS High Sierra onto a blank hard drive by using a bootable flash drive.\n\n***Before you begin, you will need to create a bootable flash drive.*** This requires having access to a Mac currently running High Sierra, in order to download the 7.7 GB High Sierra file in the App Store. You will also need an empty flash drive that can fit 5.4 GB.\n\n[guide|66371|Follow this guide to create a bootable macOS High Sierra flash drive|new_window=true] before proceeding with the guide.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- With the device powered off, disconnect any external hard drives and flash drives.\n- Plug in your [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Create+a+bootable+USB+drive/66371|macOS High Sierra bootable flash drive].\n- Hold down the '''[option]''' or '''[alt] (⌥)''' key on the keyboard and power on the device.\n- When you see the boot selection screen as shown, release the '''[option]''' key.\n- Use either the keyboard's arrow keys or the mouse to select \"Install MacOS High Sierra.\" Press '''[enter]''' or click your selection with the mouse.\n![Step 1 Image 1450956](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5dNlKcdAB4ONfx2f.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5dNlKcdAB4ONfx2f.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5dNlKcdAB4ONfx2f.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5dNlKcdAB4ONfx2f.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5dNlKcdAB4ONfx2f.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 1450957](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Uh1RXprxZ1RICqyd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Uh1RXprxZ1RICqyd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Uh1RXprxZ1RICqyd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Uh1RXprxZ1RICqyd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Uh1RXprxZ1RICqyd.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Your Mac will begin copying the installation files from the flash drive. This may take up to 30 minutes.\n> **Note:** Depending on the speed of your flash drive, it may look like progress has frozen, but it should resume if you continue to wait.\n- When prompted, select your language and press '''[enter]''', or click the arrow button.\n![Step 2 Image 1450958](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KLWkIDKrnMclhOEK.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KLWkIDKrnMclhOEK.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KLWkIDKrnMclhOEK.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KLWkIDKrnMclhOEK.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KLWkIDKrnMclhOEK.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 1450959](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqYwQmWRsOjVNNH1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqYwQmWRsOjVNNH1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqYwQmWRsOjVNNH1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqYwQmWRsOjVNNH1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqYwQmWRsOjVNNH1.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n> **Note:** If you don't need to pre-configure your hard drive, skip to step 5. If you're not sure or if the drive is used, it's a good idea to pre-configure your hard drive.\n- Select \"Disk Utility\" from the menu and press '''[enter]''' or click the continue button.\n![Step 3 Image 1450960](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DCuNO5hDiGNaCmLG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DCuNO5hDiGNaCmLG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DCuNO5hDiGNaCmLG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DCuNO5hDiGNaCmLG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DCuNO5hDiGNaCmLG.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 1450961](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2OCEict6yKIlqpWb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2OCEict6yKIlqpWb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2OCEict6yKIlqpWb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2OCEict6yKIlqpWb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2OCEict6yKIlqpWb.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Select your hard drive from the left column in Disk Utility.\n> **Note:** It is most likely the uninitialized drive.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** If you have multiple hard drives, make sure you select the correct one as the next step will wipe the selected drive clean.\n  - Click the \"Erase\" button at the top of the window.\n  - Choose a name for your drive (you can rename it later). Leave the scheme as '''GUID Partition Map'''.\n  - If you are installing an SSD, choose the '''APFS''' format. If you are installing a mechanical drive or if your device doesn't officially support the newer OS, leave the format as '''Mac OS Extended (journaled)'''\n  - Click \"Erase.\" When the process completes, click \"Done.\"\n  - Exit the Disk Utility by clicking on the red X button on the top left corner of the window.\n![Step 4 Image 1450966](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SSqoTYYhQnxkZWAE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SSqoTYYhQnxkZWAE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SSqoTYYhQnxkZWAE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SSqoTYYhQnxkZWAE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SSqoTYYhQnxkZWAE.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 1450967](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BpqX5AeALjIGJmyQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BpqX5AeALjIGJmyQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BpqX5AeALjIGJmyQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BpqX5AeALjIGJmyQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BpqX5AeALjIGJmyQ.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 1450968](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMcPJ36jcbkNBoVY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMcPJ36jcbkNBoVY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMcPJ36jcbkNBoVY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMcPJ36jcbkNBoVY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FMcPJ36jcbkNBoVY.full -->\n\n## 5.

Step 6\n- Read through the license agreement.\n- Click \"Agree\" to accept the license agreement.\n- Your Mac will now install macOS High Sierra. Be patient and wait for it to complete.\n- Once the install is complete, the device will restart itself.\n![Step 6 Image 1450972](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGuRjID2HKhj51AR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGuRjID2HKhj51AR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGuRjID2HKhj51AR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGuRjID2HKhj51AR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGuRjID2HKhj51AR.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 1450973](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CNHDiRuPX4L1DFCF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CNHDiRuPX4L1DFCF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CNHDiRuPX4L1DFCF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CNHDiRuPX4L1DFCF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CNHDiRuPX4L1DFCF.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 1450974](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QcXBwxHMwtUkQcAu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QcXBwxHMwtUkQcAu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QcXBwxHMwtUkQcAu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QcXBwxHMwtUkQcAu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QcXBwxHMwtUkQcAu.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHigh Sierra should now be freshly installed!

For more information about writing teardown guides, check out our how to take [guide|718|awesome photos guide] and the [[Info:Teardown_FAQ|Teardown FAQ]]. You can also take a look at our [[Info:Teardown|Teardown Guidelines]] to get ideas on how to write an awesome teardown!\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- To begin, decide what you want to take apart.  Some examples of things '''not''' to take apart include:\n  - Your pet poodle.\n  - Grandpa's pacemaker.\n  - Any device containing plutonium.\n  - Optimus Prime.\n- Next, make your way to the store to pick up your new device.  We prefer eco-friendly leg power, but to each their own.\n- Enter the store to find what you are looking for.  If necessary, camp outside the store to be the first in line.\n![Step 1 Image 8459](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/khWp63IhFNfsYsrF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/khWp63IhFNfsYsrF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/khWp63IhFNfsYsrF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/khWp63IhFNfsYsrF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/khWp63IhFNfsYsrF.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 8451](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mryhBFqVvj6TwPvg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mryhBFqVvj6TwPvg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mryhBFqVvj6TwPvg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mryhBFqVvj6TwPvg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mryhBFqVvj6TwPvg.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 8447](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NUqn2vY4GVBsQx2Q.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NUqn2vY4GVBsQx2Q.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NUqn2vY4GVBsQx2Q.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NUqn2vY4GVBsQx2Q.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NUqn2vY4GVBsQx2Q.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Next, find your device of choice in the store.  Try not to tackle the 70 year-old woman who just took the last one off the shelf.\n- Don't forget to pay for the product. Contrary to popular belief, Jedi mind tricks do not work on security guards.\n- Politely decline the extended warranty.\n![Step 2 Image 8444](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PvQkpsNBYcPbENKj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PvQkpsNBYcPbENKj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PvQkpsNBYcPbENKj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PvQkpsNBYcPbENKj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PvQkpsNBYcPbENKj.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 8470](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gLphVEWZAhTHlOsj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gLphVEWZAhTHlOsj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gLphVEWZAhTHlOsj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gLphVEWZAhTHlOsj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gLphVEWZAhTHlOsj.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 8469](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NDJROWKa6gCfmXGm.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NDJROWKa6gCfmXGm.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NDJROWKa6gCfmXGm.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NDJROWKa6gCfmXGm.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NDJROWKa6gCfmXGm.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Now that you're safely home, unbox your new beauty and bask in its technological superiority.  If you watch closely enough, you can witness your device depreciating.\n- Don't forget to pretend to read the instruction manual before throwing it away.\n- With your new device up and running, its time to actually enjoy your new purchase.  Remember: water + electronics = shattered dreams.\n![Step 3 Image 8452](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIMYKehZdYUmhnMq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIMYKehZdYUmhnMq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIMYKehZdYUmhnMq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIMYKehZdYUmhnMq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIMYKehZdYUmhnMq.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 8453](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/npLOwhfVqBYdiGXV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/npLOwhfVqBYdiGXV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/npLOwhfVqBYdiGXV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/npLOwhfVqBYdiGXV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/npLOwhfVqBYdiGXV.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 8457](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Xr2SYywBCQGUUnDc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Xr2SYywBCQGUUnDc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Xr2SYywBCQGUUnDc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Xr2SYywBCQGUUnDc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Xr2SYywBCQGUUnDc.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Make sure to keep track of all the appropriate tools.\n- Use extreme caution when disassembling the device, unless your intention is to show the destruction of a device. In that case, proceed as planned.\n- Most important of all, make sure to have fun!\n![Step 4 Image 8460](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EnJ4qQmxQwivZNWk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EnJ4qQmxQwivZNWk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EnJ4qQmxQwivZNWk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EnJ4qQmxQwivZNWk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EnJ4qQmxQwivZNWk.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 8468](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MWCvRTiihXvBcXwH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MWCvRTiihXvBcXwH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MWCvRTiihXvBcXwH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MWCvRTiihXvBcXwH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MWCvRTiihXvBcXwH.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- It's now time to setup the photo room environment.\n- Lighting is essential for good photographs. Set up lamps and focus the light near your work area.\n- We recommend attaching a portable lamp to a tripod to aid in precisely focusing light.\n![Step 5 Image 8465](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pqRUUIyf1O23DaFt.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pqRUUIyf1O23DaFt.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pqRUUIyf1O23DaFt.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pqRUUIyf1O23DaFt.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pqRUUIyf1O23DaFt.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 8471](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PZdGHU5xHwPnBPCT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PZdGHU5xHwPnBPCT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PZdGHU5xHwPnBPCT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PZdGHU5xHwPnBPCT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PZdGHU5xHwPnBPCT.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- With all the proper equipment set up, you can now move on to the actual disassembly of the device.\n- During disassembly, document all your steps with notes and pictures to share your knowledge with the iFixit community.\n- You can place a sheet of white paper beneath your workspace for better pictures.\n> **Note:** Included is a teardown shot taken under our professional lighting setup. Actual results may vary.\n![Step 6 Image 8463](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eMeTORjfxiPuEBoI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eMeTORjfxiPuEBoI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eMeTORjfxiPuEBoI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eMeTORjfxiPuEBoI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eMeTORjfxiPuEBoI.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 8467](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EqoYrbT5t14P2O1Z.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EqoYrbT5t14P2O1Z.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EqoYrbT5t14P2O1Z.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EqoYrbT5t14P2O1Z.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EqoYrbT5t14P2O1Z.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 8474](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILWjtTQEOVHvwmO4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILWjtTQEOVHvwmO4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILWjtTQEOVHvwmO4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILWjtTQEOVHvwmO4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ILWjtTQEOVHvwmO4.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Now it's time to share your knowledge with the world by indulging in one of the most honored traditions of all time: writing.\n- Invoke your imagination and unleash your writing ability upon the iFixit community.\n![Step 7 Image 8461](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IEjPZcu6AxFtUgcv.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IEjPZcu6AxFtUgcv.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IEjPZcu6AxFtUgcv.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IEjPZcu6AxFtUgcv.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IEjPZcu6AxFtUgcv.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- Now that your work is published on [link|http://www.ifixit.com|iFixit], it's time to sit back and relax and enjoy the sweet satisfaction of having created a teardown guide.\n- This calls for an iPod dance party!\n![Step 8 Image 8443](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CqylbExU3eTkuEnc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CqylbExU3eTkuEnc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CqylbExU3eTkuEnc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CqylbExU3eTkuEnc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CqylbExU3eTkuEnc.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nGreat job!

        "raw_content": "# Constructing a Capacitor Discharge Tool\n\n[link|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor|Capacitors] are electronic components found in almost every device containing a circuit board. Large capacitors can store enough charge to cause injuries, so they must be discharged properly.\n\nThis guide will show you how to make a simple resistor-based capacitor discharge tool.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- To construct a capacitor discharge tool, first gather the necessary materials. These include:\n  - Two lengths of wire. Minimum wire requirements is 12AWG, 600 volt rating for large electrolytic  capacitors used in power supplies, electric motor start circuits and camera flash circuitry\n  - A resistor rated to dissipate the amount of thermal energy created when discharging the capacitor. Minimum requirements for resistor is 2k OHM 5w for small capacitors, 20k OHM 5w for large electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies, electric motor start circuits and camera flash circuitry.\n  - Shrink tubing\n![Step 1 Image 36259](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWFqMgtGJtlahiev.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWFqMgtGJtlahiev.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWFqMgtGJtlahiev.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWFqMgtGJtlahiev.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWFqMgtGJtlahiev.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Begin the process by stripping one side end of each length of wire.\n> **Note:** To ensure a solid solder joint, strip at least .25\" of insulation off the wire.\n![Step 2 Image 36260](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yVv1ZuX4gGPCxaCQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yVv1ZuX4gGPCxaCQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yVv1ZuX4gGPCxaCQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yVv1ZuX4gGPCxaCQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yVv1ZuX4gGPCxaCQ.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 36261](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UPDhAuQSFqZoBXSQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UPDhAuQSFqZoBXSQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UPDhAuQSFqZoBXSQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UPDhAuQSFqZoBXSQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UPDhAuQSFqZoBXSQ.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Next, trim both of the leads leaving the resistor to match the length of insulation stripped off the wires in the previous step.\n![Step 3 Image 36262](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3D6PJNgTAtEFNWnQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3D6PJNgTAtEFNWnQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3D6PJNgTAtEFNWnQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3D6PJNgTAtEFNWnQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3D6PJNgTAtEFNWnQ.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 36263](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uwbwg1KGoxTP5Dxp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uwbwg1KGoxTP5Dxp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uwbwg1KGoxTP5Dxp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uwbwg1KGoxTP5Dxp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uwbwg1KGoxTP5Dxp.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Join the lead leaving the resistor to the stripped end of the wire by twisting the two together.\n> **Note:** The wire we are using is quite thick, so we inserted the resistor lead down the center of the conductor portion of the wire and twisted the wire against it as tightly as possible.\n- Solder the wire to the resistor.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** It is essential that enough solder flows through the wire to create a permanent bond between the two pieces.\n![Step 4 Image 36264](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5cgXgYKRqhLZLlbA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5cgXgYKRqhLZLlbA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5cgXgYKRqhLZLlbA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5cgXgYKRqhLZLlbA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5cgXgYKRqhLZLlbA.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 36265](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H6rGWNaDwII42sPT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H6rGWNaDwII42sPT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H6rGWNaDwII42sPT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H6rGWNaDwII42sPT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H6rGWNaDwII42sPT.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 36266](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5L3IlDPKjQD4X4Y.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5L3IlDPKjQD4X4Y.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5L3IlDPKjQD4X4Y.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5L3IlDPKjQD4X4Y.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5L3IlDPKjQD4X4Y.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Slide a section of shrink tubing up the wire, making sure to completely cover up the solder joint and any exposed wire.\n- Use a heat gun or lighter to shrink the tubing over the joint, making sure it is positioned to cover all exposed wire.\n![Step 5 Image 36267](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3wXktcjlRfrJmpLW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3wXktcjlRfrJmpLW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3wXktcjlRfrJmpLW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3wXktcjlRfrJmpLW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3wXktcjlRfrJmpLW.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 36268](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFXMQBUUARWQBJhd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFXMQBUUARWQBJhd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFXMQBUUARWQBJhd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFXMQBUUARWQBJhd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFXMQBUUARWQBJhd.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Repeat the above process for the other side of the resistor.\n- To complete the discharge tool, strip the ends of the wires.\n> **Note:** To discharge from small points, it may be helpful to cut the exposed ends of wire into a point shape and solder them to maintain the shape. Alternatively, the probes commonly used on multimeters can be soldered to the wires to create a more precise discharge tool.\n> **Note:** For large electrolytic capacitors used in power supplies, electric motor start circuits, and camera flash units, you may want to solder one end to a large alligator clip and the other to a well insulated screwdriver.\n![Step 6 Image 36269](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b62RVZWXlVbuXpKk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b62RVZWXlVbuXpKk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b62RVZWXlVbuXpKk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b62RVZWXlVbuXpKk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b62RVZWXlVbuXpKk.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Desoldering Technique\n\nThis guide will show the process of removing solder from a solder junction.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Gather your solder gun and soldering paste. The soldering paste I use is very cheap and last very long and I apply it with a plastic pry tool, there are other better methods to apply such as the type that comes in a syringe style tube.You will also need desoldering wire or (wick) which conducts heat well and therefore absorbs the old solder.\n![Step 1 Image 307564](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IbfNMViAVaPnMuCs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IbfNMViAVaPnMuCs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IbfNMViAVaPnMuCs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IbfNMViAVaPnMuCs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IbfNMViAVaPnMuCs.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- It is very helpful to add some soldering paste to the area of the logic board you will be removing solder from—it will help make the process easier and prevent from possibly pulling a pad off the logic board. I am desoldering the + and - battery connections above the SPK points in the picture.\n- Apply the de-soldering wick to the area you are removing the solder from and hold the solder gun on it so it can soak the solder up in the wick. Be very careful to not leave the solder gun on too long as the logic board components are very fragile.\n- Carefully remove the soldering iron and the wick at the same time. If you remove the solder gun first and then the wick the solder can harden and you could possibly pull components off the board. As you can see the solder pads on the logic board are clean with no excess and ready for fresh solder.\n![Step 2 Image 307573](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6lIrDPo1ZINHicag.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6lIrDPo1ZINHicag.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6lIrDPo1ZINHicag.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6lIrDPo1ZINHicag.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6lIrDPo1ZINHicag.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 307570](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TFLpKAnAg2eN1Stj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TFLpKAnAg2eN1Stj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TFLpKAnAg2eN1Stj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TFLpKAnAg2eN1Stj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TFLpKAnAg2eN1Stj.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 307576](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WQRjtGTNXRLTTvtB.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WQRjtGTNXRLTTvtB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WQRjtGTNXRLTTvtB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WQRjtGTNXRLTTvtB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WQRjtGTNXRLTTvtB.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Repairing iPhone Liquid Damage\n\nRefer to the iPhone [[Topic:iPhone|repair guides]] for instructions on disassembling your iPhone. You may need a soft brush, isopropyl alcohol, and a container that is large enough to submerge your iPhones' logic board in alcohol. The cleaning steps may require several repetitions to achieve a good result. These cleaning suggestions may not restore your phone to working order, but once you have eliminated any liquid and cleaned away any corrosion or debris you may be able to determine if any parts need to be replaced.\n\nFor more information consult the [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/liquid/95280|iPhone Liquid Damage Repair|new_window=true] guide.\n\n## 1. Assessing visible external damage\n- Look for liquid or residue between the touchscreen and LCD. This phone shows water build-up between the touchscreen and LCD, and most likely contains more liquid inside.\n- In this case, there is no obvious damage or corrosion in the external dock connector.\n- There is no obvious damage or corrosion in the headphone jack.\n![Step 1 Image 107988](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MjAWVcjjEXgaRoSU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MjAWVcjjEXgaRoSU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MjAWVcjjEXgaRoSU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MjAWVcjjEXgaRoSU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MjAWVcjjEXgaRoSU.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 107990](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQHKdnOAwilRmMgk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQHKdnOAwilRmMgk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQHKdnOAwilRmMgk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQHKdnOAwilRmMgk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQHKdnOAwilRmMgk.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 107992](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jsYuTj45U2Sus1GY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jsYuTj45U2Sus1GY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jsYuTj45U2Sus1GY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jsYuTj45U2Sus1GY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jsYuTj45U2Sus1GY.full -->\n\n## 2. Disassembly\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Liquid damage inside the phone may complicate disassembly. Beware of cables and connectors that may be adhered to other components in unexpected ways.\n- Lifting the front panel of this phone, the flex for the dock connector has stuck to the back of the midframe.\n![Step 2 Image 107994](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eE1MUQsO16RRkN4G.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eE1MUQsO16RRkN4G.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eE1MUQsO16RRkN4G.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eE1MUQsO16RRkN4G.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eE1MUQsO16RRkN4G.full -->\n\n## 3. Assessing visible internal damage\n- The water damage sticker is now pink, indicating that the inside of this phone was flooded with liquid.\n- Residue and corrosion discoloration can clearly be seen on the connectors for the LCD, Digitizer, and proximity sensor, as well as the camera and SIM card slot.\n![Step 3 Image 111051](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sYEwEllkxHarue1E.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sYEwEllkxHarue1E.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sYEwEllkxHarue1E.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sYEwEllkxHarue1E.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sYEwEllkxHarue1E.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 111053](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iYId2fIuMEvnGq3q.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iYId2fIuMEvnGq3q.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iYId2fIuMEvnGq3q.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iYId2fIuMEvnGq3q.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iYId2fIuMEvnGq3q.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 111052](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WwIxVuon4Vqif5HL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WwIxVuon4Vqif5HL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WwIxVuon4Vqif5HL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WwIxVuon4Vqif5HL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WwIxVuon4Vqif5HL.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- The dock connector water sensor sticker has turned pink too, indicating liquid flooding of this end of the phone.\n- The top of this dock connector looks fairly clean, with only a few green corrosive changes near connector 4.\n![Step 4 Image 111055](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QbLgJ6qSiQdrvOSe.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QbLgJ6qSiQdrvOSe.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QbLgJ6qSiQdrvOSe.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QbLgJ6qSiQdrvOSe.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QbLgJ6qSiQdrvOSe.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 111054](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/T4oxNS5LMeKTNEaU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/T4oxNS5LMeKTNEaU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/T4oxNS5LMeKTNEaU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/T4oxNS5LMeKTNEaU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/T4oxNS5LMeKTNEaU.full -->\n\n## 5.

Removing the logic board shield cover\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Depending on the nature of the liquid damage, removing this shield may not be necessary, and doing so risks damaging the small components mounted on the logic board. If you decide to remove the shield, proceed cautiously and use a plastic tool such as a [product|IF145-002|spudger], or a [product|IF145-000|plastic opening tool] to lever off the shield.\n- Look for the dimpled tabs on the shield that reach down over the tabs attached to the mother board.\n- Using your plastic tool, catch the edge of a dimpled tab near a corner of the shield, and pry it up away from the logic board.\n- Being careful of all the tiny surface mounted components, work your way around the available edges until the shield comes free.\n![Step 10 Image 111097](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1ELRjo4fZZMQWtwg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1ELRjo4fZZMQWtwg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1ELRjo4fZZMQWtwg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1ELRjo4fZZMQWtwg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1ELRjo4fZZMQWtwg.full -->\n![Step 10 Image 108062](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bc3ryPBKKifkTVPO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bc3ryPBKKifkTVPO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bc3ryPBKKifkTVPO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bc3ryPBKKifkTVPO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bc3ryPBKKifkTVPO.full -->\n\n## 11. Cleaning the logic board\n- Submerge the logic board in isopropyl alcohol, and allow it to soak long enough to loosen hardened residue, and to displace any remaining water or other liquid. Use a soft brush to remove visible corrosion and residue.\n- Residue from motherboard left in isopropyl alcohol container.\n- Clean all flex ends, battery contacts, connectors, chips, and fuses on motherboard with a soft brush.\n- Repeat cleaning if necessary, or if traces of residue are still visible.\n- Allow the logic board or other parts to dry completely before reassembly.\n![Step 11 Image 108088](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TYTijXyLXn3JvliU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TYTijXyLXn3JvliU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TYTijXyLXn3JvliU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TYTijXyLXn3JvliU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TYTijXyLXn3JvliU.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 111085](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIJkpOsUH4CdkjeP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIJkpOsUH4CdkjeP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIJkpOsUH4CdkjeP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIJkpOsUH4CdkjeP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIJkpOsUH4CdkjeP.full -->\n\n## 12. Cleaning the LCD\n- Wipe LCD with cloth moistened with isopropyl alcohol. Immersion isn't advised, as liquid may leave a mark behind the LCD.\n- This is the screen after cleaning. Water mark is no longer visible.\n![Step 12 Image 108094](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SkO6LY5awojVfOpW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SkO6LY5awojVfOpW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SkO6LY5awojVfOpW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SkO6LY5awojVfOpW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SkO6LY5awojVfOpW.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device refer to the iPhone [[Topic:iPhone|repair guides]] for your particular phone.\n\nAfter repeated cleaning, this example phone needed connectors 1, 2, and 3 replaced on the logic board, a new LCD, and digitizer. Corrosion on the cable ends and connectors could not be adequately removed. All other functions worked and this iPhone is now back in working order. Good luck. Hopefully this guide demonstrates that liquid damage to your iPhone isn't always obvious or visible and that disassembly and cleaning may benefit some phones exposed to liquid.",

        "raw_content": "# (OBSOLETE) How to jailbreak iOS 4.0 - 4.0.1\n\n'''IMPORTANT: THIS GUIDE IS OBSOLETE. Very few modern apps support iOS 4.x and methods like this have been superseded.'''\n\nJailbreaking your iOS device installs Cydia, an alternative to the App Store, which is full of cool things like themes, tweaks, and apps that you won't find on the App Store, like Grooveshark (Apple blocked it) and Mewseek, which allows you to add music to your iOS Device without syncing it with iTunes.\n\nThis guide will show you how to use jailbreakme.com, designed by @comex, to jailbreak iOS firmwares 4.0 and 4.0.1 .\n\nWARNING: Jailbreaking technically voids your Apple warranty, however, you can easily get your warranty back by restoring your iOS Device to stock Apple firmware using iTunes.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- First step, power on your iDevice if you haven't already done so.\n- Now, once you're powered up and ready, navigate to settings.app and turn on WiFi and connect to a network.\n![Step 1 Image 133973](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UBStXEHm5GWyN4RJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UBStXEHm5GWyN4RJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UBStXEHm5GWyN4RJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UBStXEHm5GWyN4RJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UBStXEHm5GWyN4RJ.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Now, close settings and open up Safari.app\n- Navigate your browser to http://www.jailbreakme.com\n- slide to jailbreak!\n![Step 2 Image 133968](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQnVSsgEeDAE5EfL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQnVSsgEeDAE5EfL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQnVSsgEeDAE5EfL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQnVSsgEeDAE5EfL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mQnVSsgEeDAE5EfL.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- There is now a short interlude whilst safari downloads a pdf, which is how jailbreak me.com works.\n- Then it'll do some stuff which actually jailbreaks the device and install Cydia for you.\n- Then it'll tell you it's done and Cydia is installed on the home screen, then it will reboot, this might take a little longer than you're used to.\n![Step 3 Image 125832](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AB3mpGCIH6fvgSKQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AB3mpGCIH6fvgSKQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AB3mpGCIH6fvgSKQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AB3mpGCIH6fvgSKQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AB3mpGCIH6fvgSKQ.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- When you've successfully rebooted, Cydia will be on one your pages of apps, usually not the first page.\n- Launch Cydia and it will reorganise some files and then respring your iPod, which is like logging out and then back in to your PC almost.\n- Launch Cydia again and it'll ask whether you're a User, a Developer or a Hacker. Most people are users, leave the scary stuff alone, you probably won't need it.\n- Cydia will now refresh it's sources and reload its data, once that's done, you can browse it's vast collection of tweaks, apps and themes.\n- You're done! If you have any problems, check out jailbreakqa.com which is full of helpful people who know all about jailbreaking.\n- Credit to @comex for the exploit, untether and jailbreakme.com and huge credit to @Saurik for writing, developing and maintaining Cydia.\n![Step 4 Image 133971](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5YIRikYieBSRAigM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5YIRikYieBSRAigM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5YIRikYieBSRAigM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5YIRikYieBSRAigM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5YIRikYieBSRAigM.full -->",

This guide will help you through the steps while teaching you about soldering, resistor reading, and component polarity. Soon, you'll be ready to replace the battery in your  [guide|749|iPod Nano 3rd Generation|stepid=4006].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Before diving into the assembly of your brain game, we should go over the procedure for through-hole soldering.\n- Why is it called through-hole, you ask? You'll notice the circuit board has a bunch of holes in it, each with a copper trace on the underside of the board. The leads of each component are fed through these holes (hence through-hole) and soldered to the copper trace.\n> **Note:** Through-hole soldering is generally regarded as the simplest form of soldering.\n![Step 1 Image 121456](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/It1W4dOcuXtABas5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/It1W4dOcuXtABas5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/It1W4dOcuXtABas5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/It1W4dOcuXtABas5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/It1W4dOcuXtABas5.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 121177](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGJMXqrKn1GVcvC6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGJMXqrKn1GVcvC6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGJMXqrKn1GVcvC6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGJMXqrKn1GVcvC6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JGJMXqrKn1GVcvC6.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- The most important tool for any soldering job? Your soldering iron, of course! For this procedure we'll be using the soldering station that we sell in our parts and tools store.\n- For this project, you won't want your soldering iron to exceed 40 watts ''at the tip''. For our station which ''draws'' 50 watts of power from the wall, it is safe to crank it up all the way to max.\n- If this is the first time you're firing up your soldering iron, you may notice some smoke and a not-so-pleasant scent. Don't worry; this is just the coating on the tip burning off. Wait a couple minutes for the soldering iron to stop smoking.\n- Before you start soldering, be sure to dampen your cleaning sponge. A dry sponge will just get burned.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** It is always a good precaution to wear safety goggles while soldering. Hot pieces of solder occasionally shoot off and a scorching piece of metal to the eye will ruin even the greatest optimist's day.\n![Step 2 Image 121176](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pIeELUYshAoWxHpD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pIeELUYshAoWxHpD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pIeELUYshAoWxHpD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pIeELUYshAoWxHpD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pIeELUYshAoWxHpD.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 121178](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AFCDHNWVF2gqXIMS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AFCDHNWVF2gqXIMS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AFCDHNWVF2gqXIMS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AFCDHNWVF2gqXIMS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AFCDHNWVF2gqXIMS.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- We'll start with resistor R1 in your kit, which has yellow, purple, brown, and gold rings on it (more on what these colored rings mean later).\n- Bend the leads of the resistor to 90^^o^^ angles about 1.5 mm away from the body of the resistor.\n![Step 3 Image 121174](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oXtBCtCIfgVbYOTm.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oXtBCtCIfgVbYOTm.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oXtBCtCIfgVbYOTm.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oXtBCtCIfgVbYOTm.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oXtBCtCIfgVbYOTm.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 121175](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EROONucHdvCegqyk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EROONucHdvCegqyk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EROONucHdvCegqyk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EROONucHdvCegqyk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EROONucHdvCegqyk.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 121179](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZoLbrQKvIntSllN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZoLbrQKvIntSllN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZoLbrQKvIntSllN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZoLbrQKvIntSllN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZoLbrQKvIntSllN.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Place the leads of the resistor through the holes on either side of the rectangle marked '''R1''' on the circuit board.\n> **Note:** Resistors do not have to be installed in a particular orientation. Either lead can go into either hole.\n- Turn the board over so that the copper traces are facing up and the resistor leads are pointing straight up in the air, as seen in the second picture.\n> **Note:** You may also bend the leads outward to hold the resistor in place, but this is not necessary. As per NASA guidelines, any angle up to 30° down from vertical is acceptable.\n![Step 4 Image 121180](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDlFquAATTFBuRPF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDlFquAATTFBuRPF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDlFquAATTFBuRPF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDlFquAATTFBuRPF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDlFquAATTFBuRPF.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 121181](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mVZ2usDSEuddQyZc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mVZ2usDSEuddQyZc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mVZ2usDSEuddQyZc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mVZ2usDSEuddQyZc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mVZ2usDSEuddQyZc.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- You must be itching to throw down some molten metal by now; however, you still need to prepare the tip of your soldering iron.\n- Now that your soldering iron's tip is hot, clean it by melting a small amount of solder directly on the tip and wiping it off on your damp sponge.\n- Melt another small ball of solder onto the tip of the soldering iron, but do not wipe it off. This is called \"tinning\" the iron, and will improve heat conductivity, allowing you to solder more quickly and efficiently.\n> **Note:** Regular cleaning and tinning of your soldering iron while working will lead to better solder joints and longer tip life.\n![Step 5 Image 121453](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HKEEAeOXxNj4qhPd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HKEEAeOXxNj4qhPd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HKEEAeOXxNj4qhPd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HKEEAeOXxNj4qhPd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HKEEAeOXxNj4qhPd.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 121183](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/antYqvNHf316M36g.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/antYqvNHf316M36g.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/antYqvNHf316M36g.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/antYqvNHf316M36g.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/antYqvNHf316M36g.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 121184](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IIpIPV5wXKvqIvjI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IIpIPV5wXKvqIvjI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IIpIPV5wXKvqIvjI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IIpIPV5wXKvqIvjI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IIpIPV5wXKvqIvjI.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Here we are: the moment of truth. It's time to get that solder flowing.\n- Set the tip of the [product|IF145-495|soldering iron|new_window=true] on the two parts to be connected. In this case, that's the resistor lead and the copper trace on the circuit board.\n- Touch your solder to the tip of your soldering iron to melt it onto the joint. Don't hold it there for more than a second or two.\n- Quickly, but not frantically, pull both the soldering iron and the solder away from the joint.\n- Your solder joint should be shiny and conical, and not expand beyond the copper trace.\n![Step 6 Image 121185](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jpPixVGrbR2srAHy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jpPixVGrbR2srAHy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jpPixVGrbR2srAHy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jpPixVGrbR2srAHy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jpPixVGrbR2srAHy.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 121186](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Zh2SNRIPwJ5RqRdC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Zh2SNRIPwJ5RqRdC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Zh2SNRIPwJ5RqRdC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Zh2SNRIPwJ5RqRdC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Zh2SNRIPwJ5RqRdC.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 121187](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AuHDI5SBdnsBEDNA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AuHDI5SBdnsBEDNA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AuHDI5SBdnsBEDNA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AuHDI5SBdnsBEDNA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AuHDI5SBdnsBEDNA.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Use the same method above to solder the second resistor lead to the circuit board.\n> **Note:** After soldering a joint, if you are going to put the soldering iron down, be sure to place it back in its stand to prevent burning yourself or anything around you.\n- Cut the extra lengths of the resistor leads with a pair of wire cutters. NASA workmanship standards state that any length up to 2.29 mm is acceptable.\n![Step 7 Image 121188](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vCjYRpK4nBDgRoeL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vCjYRpK4nBDgRoeL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vCjYRpK4nBDgRoeL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vCjYRpK4nBDgRoeL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vCjYRpK4nBDgRoeL.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 121317](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3xQheAJh6uBZadpU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3xQheAJh6uBZadpU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3xQheAJh6uBZadpU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3xQheAJh6uBZadpU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3xQheAJh6uBZadpU.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 121316](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nVNVyUjK2qAl6oIR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nVNVyUjK2qAl6oIR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nVNVyUjK2qAl6oIR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nVNVyUjK2qAl6oIR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nVNVyUjK2qAl6oIR.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- We all make mistakes, especially when trying something new. Soldering is no exception, so here's what to do when one of your soldered joints comes out less than ideal.\n- Lay a strand of desoldering braid over the solder in question. Press the tip of the soldering iron firmly onto the desoldering braid. This will heat up both the solder and the braid.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not hold the braid close to the solder point while using it—it gets very hot and can burn you.\n> **Note:** Be careful not to lay the desoldering braid across the fiberglass circuit board. As the braid heats up, it could leave marks in the board.\n- The solder should flow from the joint to the desoldering braid. After the solder flows into the braid, remove it and the soldering iron from the board. You should now have a clean contact to start over with. Use wire cutters to cut off the used end of the desoldering braid.\n![Step 8 Image 121236](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cth6eU2C3XwJ6VG6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cth6eU2C3XwJ6VG6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cth6eU2C3XwJ6VG6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cth6eU2C3XwJ6VG6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cth6eU2C3XwJ6VG6.full -->\n![Step 8 Image 121237](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gnAajFmvNRtrJo2b.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gnAajFmvNRtrJo2b.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gnAajFmvNRtrJo2b.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gnAajFmvNRtrJo2b.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gnAajFmvNRtrJo2b.full -->\n\n## 9. Step 9\n- So, what are resistors, and why do we care about them? Resistors are components used in circuitry to control the amount of current flow. The more resistance a resistor has (measured in Ohms, Ω), the less current it allows to flow.\n- The colored bands on a resistor are the key to determining the resistance of that particular resistor. A [http://www.bcdxc.org/resistor_color_codes.htm|resistor color code chart] will come in handy here.\n- If there are four bands on your resistor, the first band to locate is the red, gold, or silver band on one of the swollen ends; these are called tolerance bands. Since our resistors have gold bands, we know the actual resistance is within ±5% of the nominal value\n- The next step is to determine the nominal value of your resistor. Starting at the opposite side of the tolerance band and moving from left to right, there are three colored bands. The first two color bands correspond to a number (0-9), and the third band is the multiplier band, which corresponds to a specific power of 10.\n- Looking at the top resistor shown, we see yellow, violet, and red bands. Consulting a resistor color code chart shows us that those correspond to 4, 7, and 100, respectively, giving us a nominal resistance of 4,700 Ω.\n> **Note:** Can you determine the resistance of the bottom resistor?\n![Step 9 Image 121323](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VZ5UnKe3jMmnegEV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VZ5UnKe3jMmnegEV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VZ5UnKe3jMmnegEV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VZ5UnKe3jMmnegEV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VZ5UnKe3jMmnegEV.full -->\n\n## 10. Step 10\n- Install the three remaining 470 Ω resistors (yellow/violet/brown) into the terminals marked '''R2''', '''R3''', and '''R4'''.\n![Step 10 Image 121318](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sv5iK2eHcVRqJjRM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sv5iK2eHcVRqJjRM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sv5iK2eHcVRqJjRM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sv5iK2eHcVRqJjRM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sv5iK2eHcVRqJjRM.full -->\n![Step 10 Image 121193](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GEAOOAChvydFtcWM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GEAOOAChvydFtcWM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GEAOOAChvydFtcWM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GEAOOAChvydFtcWM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GEAOOAChvydFtcWM.full -->\n![Step 10 Image 121194](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/E2MOvVNmnyrcNZMq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/E2MOvVNmnyrcNZMq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/E2MOvVNmnyrcNZMq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/E2MOvVNmnyrcNZMq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/E2MOvVNmnyrcNZMq.full -->\n\n## 11. Step 11\n- Fish the two yellow/violet/red resistors out of your kit.\n> **Note:** Consulting our resistor color code chart tells us that these resistors have a 4,700 Ω resistance.\n- Install these two resistors into the '''R5''' and '''R6''' terminals on the circuit board.\n![Step 11 Image 121195](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YmSMSgEkWPyCDRFw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YmSMSgEkWPyCDRFw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YmSMSgEkWPyCDRFw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YmSMSgEkWPyCDRFw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YmSMSgEkWPyCDRFw.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 121322](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tTgaBsfjXO56K2fO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tTgaBsfjXO56K2fO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tTgaBsfjXO56K2fO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tTgaBsfjXO56K2fO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tTgaBsfjXO56K2fO.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 121320](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o4kkNYniSVhvpbBd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o4kkNYniSVhvpbBd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o4kkNYniSVhvpbBd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o4kkNYniSVhvpbBd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o4kkNYniSVhvpbBd.full -->\n\n## 12.

Step 13\n- Dig around your kit a little more, and you'll find some new and exciting components with long leads attached to them.\n- These are diodes—circuitry's \"one way\" signs. Their job is to make sure that current only travels in the forward direction, from anode to cathode, while blocking it from traveling in reverse. Current enters the anode (positive terminal) and leaves the cathode (negative terminal).\n- Since they only allow current to travel in one direction, it is rather pertinent that you install diodes with the correct polarity. The stripe on a diode signifies which side is the cathode.\n![Step 13 Image 121202](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BNfHDC2le4OQDHJd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BNfHDC2le4OQDHJd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BNfHDC2le4OQDHJd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BNfHDC2le4OQDHJd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BNfHDC2le4OQDHJd.full -->\n\n## 14.

Step 16\n- No game is really a game until there are buttons involved, so let's put those on the board next.\n- Insert the leads of the four buttons into the spots marked '''SW1''' through '''SW4'''.\n- There is no particular orientation that the buttons must be installed in, as long as the leads are properly seated in their holes.\n![Step 16 Image 121332](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kRV4V1ncQ3hH21hg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kRV4V1ncQ3hH21hg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kRV4V1ncQ3hH21hg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kRV4V1ncQ3hH21hg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kRV4V1ncQ3hH21hg.full -->\n![Step 16 Image 121210](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LydLTQQE6dbHYsCJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LydLTQQE6dbHYsCJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LydLTQQE6dbHYsCJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LydLTQQE6dbHYsCJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LydLTQQE6dbHYsCJ.full -->\n\n## 17. Step 17\n- Solder each of the leads for each button.\n- The technique for soldering the buttons is the exact same as soldering the resistors and diodes, except that you do not need to cut any excess leads after soldering the joint.\n![Step 17 Image 121211](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KkALLfpllChJsmJJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KkALLfpllChJsmJJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KkALLfpllChJsmJJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KkALLfpllChJsmJJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KkALLfpllChJsmJJ.full -->\n![Step 17 Image 121212](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DbHIUigKntlkMjgL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DbHIUigKntlkMjgL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DbHIUigKntlkMjgL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DbHIUigKntlkMjgL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DbHIUigKntlkMjgL.full -->\n\n## 18. Step 18\n- Next you will install the IC socket, also known as a CPU socket. IC sockets use a mechanical connection to connect a processor to a printed circuit board. These sockets allows the processor to be easily replaced without the risk of damage associated with soldering processors directly to a circuit board.\n- Stick the eight leads of the IC socket through the holes in the rectangle marked IC1. Make sure that the semi-circle on the top of the socket lines up with the semi-circle printed on the edge of the rectangle on the circuit board.\n- Turn the board over and solder the eight leads of the IC socket to the board. Similar to soldering the buttons, there is no need to trim any excess off the leads.\n![Step 18 Image 121213](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HiwCyqQVnVcsaYLS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HiwCyqQVnVcsaYLS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HiwCyqQVnVcsaYLS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HiwCyqQVnVcsaYLS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HiwCyqQVnVcsaYLS.full -->\n![Step 18 Image 121337](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aKlcXxsSdHoWlWaJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aKlcXxsSdHoWlWaJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aKlcXxsSdHoWlWaJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aKlcXxsSdHoWlWaJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aKlcXxsSdHoWlWaJ.full -->\n![Step 18 Image 121216](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IXGVbANTIJxLYCAG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IXGVbANTIJxLYCAG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IXGVbANTIJxLYCAG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IXGVbANTIJxLYCAG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IXGVbANTIJxLYCAG.full -->\n\n## 19. Step 19\n- The next component we will be installing is the yellow capacitor. Capacitors store electrical charge, and are helpful when a circuit needs a quick shot of energy to illuminate a light or make a beep.\n- Capacitors are measured (in Farads) as the ratio of the electrical charge on each conductor to the potential difference between them. This capacitor is a 1 µF capacitor.\n- Install the capacitor in the terminal next to the IC socket marked '''C1'''. Soldering the leads of a capacitor follows the same through-hole procedure used thus far.\n> **Note:** Make sure that the printed markings on the capacitor face away from the IC socket so that you can still read it.\n![Step 19 Image 121215](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CjvXdYYVaPNwlWb1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CjvXdYYVaPNwlWb1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CjvXdYYVaPNwlWb1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CjvXdYYVaPNwlWb1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CjvXdYYVaPNwlWb1.full -->\n![Step 19 Image 121338](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HOKRh4u6AnBiiIwq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HOKRh4u6AnBiiIwq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HOKRh4u6AnBiiIwq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HOKRh4u6AnBiiIwq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HOKRh4u6AnBiiIwq.full -->\n![Step 19 Image 121219](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ec4r3RPOxBTCvoUW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ec4r3RPOxBTCvoUW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ec4r3RPOxBTCvoUW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ec4r3RPOxBTCvoUW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ec4r3RPOxBTCvoUW.full -->\n\n## 20. Step 20\n- The next components to install are the LEDs. Light emitting diodes are used in all sorts of electronics to provide bright, different colored lights.\n> **Note:** Note that the two leads are different lengths. Since an LED is a diode, it only allows current to travel in one direction, so it is important to install the correct lead in the correct hole.\n- The four LEDs belong in each of the four terminals marked '''LD1''' through '''LD4'''.\n- When installing the LEDs, insert the shorter of the two leads into the hole next to the flat part of the printed circle.\n![Step 20 Image 121218](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kLFBTxcNlZeMmDJr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kLFBTxcNlZeMmDJr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kLFBTxcNlZeMmDJr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kLFBTxcNlZeMmDJr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kLFBTxcNlZeMmDJr.full -->\n![Step 20 Image 121341](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJBjKCSbw2w1dT1h.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJBjKCSbw2w1dT1h.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJBjKCSbw2w1dT1h.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJBjKCSbw2w1dT1h.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HJBjKCSbw2w1dT1h.full -->\n![Step 20 Image 121221](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wEVjVNZRSHrOlZqQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wEVjVNZRSHrOlZqQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wEVjVNZRSHrOlZqQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wEVjVNZRSHrOlZqQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wEVjVNZRSHrOlZqQ.full -->\n\n## 21. Step 21\n- Solder each of the LEDs to the circuit board and cut the excess off each lead.\n![Step 21 Image 121222](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CmG14hTvn1XGMeVS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CmG14hTvn1XGMeVS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CmG14hTvn1XGMeVS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CmG14hTvn1XGMeVS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CmG14hTvn1XGMeVS.full -->\n![Step 21 Image 121382](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mtaWGjhTUN6g5LJd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mtaWGjhTUN6g5LJd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mtaWGjhTUN6g5LJd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mtaWGjhTUN6g5LJd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mtaWGjhTUN6g5LJd.full -->\n\n## 22. Step 22\n- Another cool electrical component‽ How exciting!\n- Transistors are used to amplify and/or switch electrical signals. This means that they can either increase an input voltage, or be used as electronic on-off switches.\n- The important thing to pay attention to when installing a transistor is that you solder each lead to the correct spot, because each one has a different purpose.\n  - One is used as the current source.\n  - One is used as a gate.\n  - One is used as a current output.\n![Step 22 Image 121226](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oEAkEcUc5PkAG1Lp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oEAkEcUc5PkAG1Lp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oEAkEcUc5PkAG1Lp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oEAkEcUc5PkAG1Lp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oEAkEcUc5PkAG1Lp.full -->\n\n## 23. Step 23\n- Locate the semi-circle labeled '''T1''' and insert the three leads through the holes.\n> **Note:** Make sure that you line up the flat part of the transistor with the flat edge of the semi-circle on the board. The two end leads fit into the holes on the ends of the flat part of the drawing. The middle lead will need to be bent so that it feeds through the hole closest to the '''T1'''.\n- Solder the three leads to the board and cut the excess off the leads.\n![Step 23 Image 121346](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfb2vPFrNTmFno2M.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfb2vPFrNTmFno2M.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfb2vPFrNTmFno2M.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfb2vPFrNTmFno2M.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfb2vPFrNTmFno2M.full -->\n![Step 23 Image 121228](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hEinueZug1Nolypr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hEinueZug1Nolypr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hEinueZug1Nolypr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hEinueZug1Nolypr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hEinueZug1Nolypr.full -->\n![Step 23 Image 121229](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4cF3X5ZfKhPQXxIC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4cF3X5ZfKhPQXxIC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4cF3X5ZfKhPQXxIC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4cF3X5ZfKhPQXxIC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4cF3X5ZfKhPQXxIC.full -->\n\n## 24. Step 24\n- Obviously, your solder creation needs to have a super sweet sound system ... or this speaker. Close enough, right?\n> **Note:** Note the '''+''' on the face of the speaker. When installing the speaker, be sure to line this '''+''' up with the '''+''' on the circuit board.\n- Insert the leads through the holes located in the circle labeled '''LS''', making sure to match up the positive terminals.\n![Step 24 Image 121230](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kBsx1vvCS63YDKcc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kBsx1vvCS63YDKcc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kBsx1vvCS63YDKcc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kBsx1vvCS63YDKcc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kBsx1vvCS63YDKcc.full -->\n![Step 24 Image 121355](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ubpOHu3HQAH1Oq1R.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ubpOHu3HQAH1Oq1R.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ubpOHu3HQAH1Oq1R.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ubpOHu3HQAH1Oq1R.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ubpOHu3HQAH1Oq1R.full -->\n![Step 24 Image 121232](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tMic1en2EOShCome.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tMic1en2EOShCome.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tMic1en2EOShCome.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tMic1en2EOShCome.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tMic1en2EOShCome.full -->\n\n## 25.

Step 26\n- ''' Bonus! ''' You thought you were just learning how to through-hole solder, but Included with this kit is a complimentary intro to [guide|750|surface-mount soldering|stepid=4050]. Surface-mount soldering is commonly used to attach batteries to circuit boards in some devices, such as  [guide|3306|iPods|stepid=16238].\n- Set the tip of your soldering iron on the large copper negative solder pad. This will allow heat to conduct through the solder pad, making soldering easier.\n- Touch your solder to the tip of the soldering iron and keep feeding it until you have a smooth, convex solder dome on the copper pad.\n> **Note:** If the solder doesn't come out quite right, you can always use the iron to melt it again or add more solder.\n![Step 26 Image 121240](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IyANEJpQP3IV6Jjk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IyANEJpQP3IV6Jjk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IyANEJpQP3IV6Jjk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IyANEJpQP3IV6Jjk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IyANEJpQP3IV6Jjk.full -->\n![Step 26 Image 121239](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FrLVVa4UAUvHLIME.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FrLVVa4UAUvHLIME.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FrLVVa4UAUvHLIME.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FrLVVa4UAUvHLIME.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FrLVVa4UAUvHLIME.full -->\n![Step 26 Image 121238](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eY3CFl5lcETUZtYE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eY3CFl5lcETUZtYE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eY3CFl5lcETUZtYE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eY3CFl5lcETUZtYE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eY3CFl5lcETUZtYE.full -->\n\n## 27.

Step 39\n- Install three AA batteries in the battery compartment.\n- Upon inserting the final battery, the four LEDs should start flashing in a clockwise pattern. Congratulations, you did it!\n- To play the game, follow these instructions:\n  - Remove one of the batteries. Then, reinsert the battery while holding the Level 2 button for no sound or the Level 1 button for sound. Release the button a couple seconds after the battery is inserted. The game will eventually power off on its own. To wake it up to play, press either the Level 1 button to play with sound, or the Level 2 button to play without sound.\n  - As the LEDs blink in a clockwise rotation, press one of the four buttons to select the level of difficulty (printed above or below the buttons).\n  - After selecting your level, the game begins. It is a typical Simon Says-like memory game. The LEDs will flash one light, then you have to click that button. Then it will flash two lights and you have to click those two buttons in order.\n  - The game progresses until you mess up the pattern or take too long to respond.\n- Have fun!

        "raw_content": "# iFixit 26 Bit Driver Kit Technique for Removing Bits\n\nConsider this a meta-guide...that is, a guide that enables other guides. Before you remove any screws, you need to use the right bit, but getting those out of the tightly packed storage area and into your driver can be a chore in itself.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Note how challenging it is to remove a required bit from the kit. Argh!\n![Step 1 Image 142662](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FWPglfdhhmToOZ5G.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FWPglfdhhmToOZ5G.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FWPglfdhhmToOZ5G.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FWPglfdhhmToOZ5G.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FWPglfdhhmToOZ5G.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Find yourself a rubber band...\n![Step 2 Image 142664](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kwPlsNLHxj5CVQJO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kwPlsNLHxj5CVQJO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kwPlsNLHxj5CVQJO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kwPlsNLHxj5CVQJO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kwPlsNLHxj5CVQJO.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Wrap said band around the bit and viola! easy bit extraction enabled. You might want to keep that handy rubber band with the kit now.\n![Step 3 Image 142665](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6pmJbWBWmTByJIUR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6pmJbWBWmTByJIUR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6pmJbWBWmTByJIUR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6pmJbWBWmTByJIUR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6pmJbWBWmTByJIUR.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Alternate, no-rubber-band solution: use the [product|IF145-020|tweezers] supplied in the bit driver kit.\n![Step 4 Image 245674](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VcTdJFkJFANNxK1F.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VcTdJFkJFANNxK1F.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VcTdJFkJFANNxK1F.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VcTdJFkJFANNxK1F.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VcTdJFkJFANNxK1F.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",

Step 1\n- So let's find out what's inside this DELICIOUS-looking Easter egg.\n![Step 1 Image 158135](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WGDXXXBJUEyj3sdD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WGDXXXBJUEyj3sdD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WGDXXXBJUEyj3sdD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WGDXXXBJUEyj3sdD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WGDXXXBJUEyj3sdD.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- First step - cut into the egg.\n- I wonder what kinds of things I'll find inside? Leprechauns? Little bunnies? The true meaning of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter|Easter]? Only time will tell.\n![Step 2 Image 158128](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IUAHwZCcClSiXdqU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IUAHwZCcClSiXdqU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IUAHwZCcClSiXdqU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IUAHwZCcClSiXdqU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IUAHwZCcClSiXdqU.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- The innards reveal a yellowy substance. Not sure what it is, but let's dig into it some more and see if we can find out.\n![Step 3 Image 158133](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mlSY6MOEALVWgVuq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mlSY6MOEALVWgVuq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mlSY6MOEALVWgVuq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mlSY6MOEALVWgVuq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mlSY6MOEALVWgVuq.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Another cut is made, more yellow is found.\n- Surprisingly, no [guide|8277|processors] have so far been found. No bunnies for that matter, either.\n![Step 4 Image 158136](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PERWthAGsHVdKB1s.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PERWthAGsHVdKB1s.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PERWthAGsHVdKB1s.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PERWthAGsHVdKB1s.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PERWthAGsHVdKB1s.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Two halves exposed... But what's the yellow stuff? Only one way to find out.\n- Current bill of materials:\n  - Yellow mystery stuff inside\n  - Pink outer layer\n  - Blue swirls\n  - Yellow dots\n  - Red Swirls\n  - Green swirls\n![Step 5 Image 158130](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HmDXtuflEsIJOrOT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HmDXtuflEsIJOrOT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HmDXtuflEsIJOrOT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HmDXtuflEsIJOrOT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HmDXtuflEsIJOrOT.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- A formal analysis found that the yellow inner filling was, in fact, yellow cake.\n- Conclusion: Easter eggs rock!\n![Step 6 Image 158134](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUCqUOygSgi1fHtM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUCqUOygSgi1fHtM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUCqUOygSgi1fHtM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUCqUOygSgi1fHtM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUCqUOygSgi1fHtM.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# 10 best ways to fix a slow Mac OS and make it fast, even faster\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- 1) RAM - Check the memory size of your Random-Access-memory. If not suitable then kindly upgrade it to experience fast execution of applications and programs. Upgrading the RAM to a higher memory size will make a huge difference in experiencing a [http://www.stellarinfo.com/mac-software/speed-up-mac.php|faster Mac]. This will even make your old Mac perform much better.\n![Step 1 Image 164341](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iMWLQkJGYhmUnIxd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iMWLQkJGYhmUnIxd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iMWLQkJGYhmUnIxd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iMWLQkJGYhmUnIxd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iMWLQkJGYhmUnIxd.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- 2) Login Items – Login items are irritating if irrelevant to your purpose. Also, they consume some space on Mac OS X hard disk drive during start up and often causes system to freeze for a while. Isn't wise to switch them the login items at start-up. To do so make visit to System Preferences > Accounts > Login Items, and unchecked irrelevant login items that you may not want to see at the start-up of your Mac.\n![Step 2 Image 164344](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bMOqBKB6qdO3B3UC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bMOqBKB6qdO3B3UC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bMOqBKB6qdO3B3UC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bMOqBKB6qdO3B3UC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bMOqBKB6qdO3B3UC.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- 3) Clean Desktop – A cleaner desktop also contributes to make your Mac faster. Make your desktop look tidy not untidy. Properly choose the files which you want to save on the desktop. Don't make it look like a mess.\n![Step 3 Image 164342](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HwcUgFRsImLjoMsm.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HwcUgFRsImLjoMsm.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HwcUgFRsImLjoMsm.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HwcUgFRsImLjoMsm.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HwcUgFRsImLjoMsm.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- 4) Trash-Bin Folder – You must often have heard your mother stressing upon you to dump of the room garbage. Apply the same with Mac trash bin, make your habit to visit the trash bin folder and after considering the files and folders don't forget to empty the trash. Doing so surely creates some free space for Mac OS hard disk drive.\n![Step 4 Image 164345](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qj232dLgjWLjND2A.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qj232dLgjWLjND2A.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qj232dLgjWLjND2A.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qj232dLgjWLjND2A.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qj232dLgjWLjND2A.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- 5) Trim your Applications – There might be plenty of applications and software that interests you but on the other hand there may few or more applications which are completely unwanted. So, why not uninstall the unwanted applications from your Mac and let contribute some more free space. Same goes with the widgets, uninstall any unwanted widget that might be consuming some space of the Mac disk drive.\n![Step 5 Image 164393](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oJGJulsPENHDaMtF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oJGJulsPENHDaMtF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oJGJulsPENHDaMtF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oJGJulsPENHDaMtF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oJGJulsPENHDaMtF.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- 6) Language Packs – At the time of installation if a software, many languages other than your default language gets installed on the main hard disk drive. These languages are of no use and thus occupy unnecessary space on Mac HDD. But removing the unwanted languages might take a lot of your time and effort if you go manually. Instead use a third party clean up Mac tool to accomplish this task. Tools like these, would clear all the unnecessary language packs from the system leaving your default language intact.\n![Step 6 Image 164346](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JODWPyNrFr2wsLom.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JODWPyNrFr2wsLom.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JODWPyNrFr2wsLom.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JODWPyNrFr2wsLom.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JODWPyNrFr2wsLom.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- 7) Switch off applications which are not used – Several apps on Mac are not being used by all the users. For instance, Universal Access, Blue-tooth, Speech Recognition are some of those apps that might not be a part of user's daily activity. So why not switch them off.\n![Step 7 Image 164347](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/X1bsJSdpKYAkYoRF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/X1bsJSdpKYAkYoRF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/X1bsJSdpKYAkYoRF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/X1bsJSdpKYAkYoRF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/X1bsJSdpKYAkYoRF.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- 8) Files and folders management - De-Clutter the Mac HDD by launching an effective files and folders management. Mac's behaviour to read the size of the folder before it begins any execution, so try to keep less number of files under a single folder. Organize the files and folders to create good amount of free space for the boot drive.\n![Step 8 Image 164348](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xiYIKeaJCEl1QUNg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xiYIKeaJCEl1QUNg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xiYIKeaJCEl1QUNg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xiYIKeaJCEl1QUNg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xiYIKeaJCEl1QUNg.full -->\n\n## 9. Step 9\n- 9) Temporary files – Each day an application or a software is used, large number of temporary files gets created and are stored upon the hard disk drive. To clear files like user, and font caches use atsutil command line program\n![Step 9 Image 164349](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QBBlMjBUTMZkT1HF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QBBlMjBUTMZkT1HF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QBBlMjBUTMZkT1HF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QBBlMjBUTMZkT1HF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QBBlMjBUTMZkT1HF.full -->\n\n## 10. Step 10\n- 10) Defrag HDD – With the help of a third party defrag utility you can can reduce or even eliminate the fragmentations present on your Mac HDD. The fragmented hard disk drive causes the OS to read and write the hard disk in a slower fashion. When the disk is defragged, the different parts of files into a single chunk of sequential memory locations.\n- The above activity though simple needs to be monitored with proper timing and effort. Mac users often look for a clean up Mac OSX utility that can do the job for them.

        "raw_content": "# How to verify and repair Mac OS X Disk Permissions\n\nIf your mac is having trouble recognizing a replacement battery or other components, you may need to repair your main disk permissions. Follow this guide as a first step in troubleshooting.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- You will want to first open Disk Utilities, which can be found in the Applications folder under Utilities\n  - Or you can take the shortcut and use Spotlight!\n![Step 1 Image 169035](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hRAi2WN6LPyEmIOJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hRAi2WN6LPyEmIOJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hRAi2WN6LPyEmIOJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hRAi2WN6LPyEmIOJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hRAi2WN6LPyEmIOJ.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 169036](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KuSXyhBWaggyLJBZ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KuSXyhBWaggyLJBZ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KuSXyhBWaggyLJBZ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KuSXyhBWaggyLJBZ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KuSXyhBWaggyLJBZ.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Once opened, you should be presented with a window that looks like this.\n  - You will want to select the name of your Mac OS X Startup disk in the left column.\n- After clicking on the name of your Hard drive, you will be presented with a few different options at the top.\n  - The First Aid heading is what you will want to be under.\n- Click on the Verify Disk Permissions, starting the process.\n![Step 2 Image 169038](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JlYkMS4CdXADlwoT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JlYkMS4CdXADlwoT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JlYkMS4CdXADlwoT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JlYkMS4CdXADlwoT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JlYkMS4CdXADlwoT.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 169045](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cfSVrLNIcn1fF1LY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cfSVrLNIcn1fF1LY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cfSVrLNIcn1fF1LY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cfSVrLNIcn1fF1LY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cfSVrLNIcn1fF1LY.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- This usually will take anywhere from 3 minutes to 15 minutes.  The best thing to do is to wait.\n- As time progresses, you will see information pop up in the window highlighted.\n  - This is good, it means that it is seeing the problems that may be keeping your computer from running well.\n![Step 3 Image 169044](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GtLRse1SqfGNB2L1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GtLRse1SqfGNB2L1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GtLRse1SqfGNB2L1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GtLRse1SqfGNB2L1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GtLRse1SqfGNB2L1.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 169047](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jWQxx3ULtaB6hCYF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jWQxx3ULtaB6hCYF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jWQxx3ULtaB6hCYF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jWQxx3ULtaB6hCYF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jWQxx3ULtaB6hCYF.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- After verifying the disk permissions, go ahead and select repair disk permissions to start that process.\n- During that time, which again should take anywhere from 3-10 minutes, feel free to get up, walk around for a few minutes, or go pet a cat.\n![Step 4 Image 169048](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DfcKyFPLkJtD4m46.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DfcKyFPLkJtD4m46.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DfcKyFPLkJtD4m46.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DfcKyFPLkJtD4m46.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DfcKyFPLkJtD4m46.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 169049](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2WsKUPmVAQPyx3RG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2WsKUPmVAQPyx3RG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2WsKUPmVAQPyx3RG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2WsKUPmVAQPyx3RG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2WsKUPmVAQPyx3RG.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCongrats!  You successfully repaired your disk permissions!  ",

        "raw_content": "# Making Visible the Users Library Directory in OS X Lion\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Many Macintosh users were excited when OS X 10.7 (Lion) was released, but after using it for a short time, many users realized that something was missing from lion.\n- The users Library directory is not where it it should be, infact, it is nowhere to be found. Fortunately, it is very simple to bring back the disappearing Library.\n![Step 1 Image 174501](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mDwCh5J5dmBYVICI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mDwCh5J5dmBYVICI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mDwCh5J5dmBYVICI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mDwCh5J5dmBYVICI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mDwCh5J5dmBYVICI.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 174502](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uTtuPmfnOMTJMspW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uTtuPmfnOMTJMspW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uTtuPmfnOMTJMspW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uTtuPmfnOMTJMspW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uTtuPmfnOMTJMspW.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- To begin the process, you will need to go to your Applications folder, which can be found in your Finder side bar.\n- Once in the Applications folder, you will want to find the Utilities folder.\n![Step 2 Image 174514](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SJnEMiv6CjtbAeAx.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SJnEMiv6CjtbAeAx.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SJnEMiv6CjtbAeAx.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SJnEMiv6CjtbAeAx.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SJnEMiv6CjtbAeAx.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- After navigating to the Utilities folder you will need to scroll down to find the Terminal application.\n![Step 3 Image 174515](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GOBY1CmZlGPUUJIS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GOBY1CmZlGPUUJIS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GOBY1CmZlGPUUJIS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GOBY1CmZlGPUUJIS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/GOBY1CmZlGPUUJIS.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Once you have opened Terminal, you will need to type ''chflags nohidden ~/Library/'' and then press ''Enter''.\n- This will immediately make your Library folder visible under your user.\n![Step 4 Image 174516](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LOABu6BoCEBjFbwg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LOABu6BoCEBjFbwg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LOABu6BoCEBjFbwg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LOABu6BoCEBjFbwg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LOABu6BoCEBjFbwg.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 174517](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CJHQWf5ds15XAKrU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CJHQWf5ds15XAKrU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CJHQWf5ds15XAKrU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CJHQWf5ds15XAKrU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CJHQWf5ds15XAKrU.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Once you have finished with Terminal, type ''exit'' to end your terminal processes. After you have typed this and hit enter you may quit out of Terminal.\n![Step 5 Image 174518](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PMDZiHYw3IWmE43.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PMDZiHYw3IWmE43.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PMDZiHYw3IWmE43.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PMDZiHYw3IWmE43.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PMDZiHYw3IWmE43.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- To hide the Library folder, simply type ''chflags hidden ~/Library'' and press ''Enter''.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Remember to type ''exit'' and press ''Enter'' before quitting Terminal.\n![Step 6 Image 174519](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IsLYAiDD1SBfYKrw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IsLYAiDD1SBfYKrw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IsLYAiDD1SBfYKrw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IsLYAiDD1SBfYKrw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IsLYAiDD1SBfYKrw.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",

        "raw_content": "# How to Restore or Apply an Oleophobic Coating\n\nUse this guide along with an oleophobic coating kit to restore the oleophobic coating on your device, or to add an oleophobic coating to your screen or screen protector. These kits can also be used to treat other glass surfaces, such as eye glasses, watches, smartwatches, and more.\n\n''The coating requires 8-12 hours to set, so it’s best to perform this procedure before bedtime.''\n\n=== What is an oleophobic coating? ===\nModern smartphones feature an oleophobic (oil-repellent) coating that protects the screen, improves smoothness, and reduces fingerprints. This coating consists of a thin layer of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophobicity|fluoropolymer-based solids] (similar to Teflon) that is bonded to the glass.\n\nOver time and use, this coating will wear off, and you may notice parts of the screen getting greasy or dirty with fingerprints more easily.\n\n## 1. Clean the surface\n- Use isopropyl alcohol to thoroughly clean the surface you are planning to apply the coating to.\n- Wipe the screen dry with a clean [product|IF145-284|microfiber cloth].\n![Step 1 Image 2040777](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ItHIwZjhaADtFJKo.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ItHIwZjhaADtFJKo.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ItHIwZjhaADtFJKo.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ItHIwZjhaADtFJKo.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ItHIwZjhaADtFJKo.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 2040778](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bYCNWxfEoawyOHKo.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bYCNWxfEoawyOHKo.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bYCNWxfEoawyOHKo.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bYCNWxfEoawyOHKo.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bYCNWxfEoawyOHKo.full -->\n\n## 2. Prepare a wiping finger\n> **Note:** '''Read the next three steps before you attempt the procedure.''' The oleophobic coating's liquid solvent evaporates very quickly when applied, so you'll need to work quickly.\n- Wrap one finger in a bit of plastic. You can use a sandwich bag or some plastic wrap.\n> **Note:** You will use this covered finger to rub the coating liquid onto the screen. This will prevent your finger from absorbing the liquid.\n![Step 2 Image 2040779](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uaAalLbUEoQlJMw1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uaAalLbUEoQlJMw1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uaAalLbUEoQlJMw1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uaAalLbUEoQlJMw1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uaAalLbUEoQlJMw1.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 2040780](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CG5RgUNNBHqcyqKP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CG5RgUNNBHqcyqKP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CG5RgUNNBHqcyqKP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CG5RgUNNBHqcyqKP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CG5RgUNNBHqcyqKP.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 2040781](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bLkbHHdX1umHkQCi.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bLkbHHdX1umHkQCi.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bLkbHHdX1umHkQCi.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bLkbHHdX1umHkQCi.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bLkbHHdX1umHkQCi.full -->\n\n## 3. Apply the coating to the surface\n- Apply 10-15 drops of the oleophobic coating liquid onto the surface.\n> **Note:** If you are coating a large surface such as a large phone or tablet, apply ten drops to a portion of the screen, and work on one portion at a time.\n![Step 3 Image 2040782](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Pf5phNaVc3GuIroT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Pf5phNaVc3GuIroT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Pf5phNaVc3GuIroT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Pf5phNaVc3GuIroT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Pf5phNaVc3GuIroT.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 2040776](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1U6DPkuJKPx1QLMI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1U6DPkuJKPx1QLMI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1U6DPkuJKPx1QLMI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1U6DPkuJKPx1QLMI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1U6DPkuJKPx1QLMI.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 2040784](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6BQ5lrnyKOWJBtyt.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6BQ5lrnyKOWJBtyt.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6BQ5lrnyKOWJBtyt.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6BQ5lrnyKOWJBtyt.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6BQ5lrnyKOWJBtyt.full -->\n\n## 4. Distribute the coating\n- Wipe your plastic-covered finger over the surface with quick, light swipes until the liquid evaporates.\n> **Note:** You don't need to rub very hard—you're just spreading out the coating molecules onto the surface before the solvent evaporates.\n- If you applied the liquid to only a portion of the surface, repeat the liquid application and rubbing procedure to the remaining surface.\n![Step 4 Image 2040785](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZgvxGjTvReJjEZL3.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZgvxGjTvReJjEZL3.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZgvxGjTvReJjEZL3.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZgvxGjTvReJjEZL3.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZgvxGjTvReJjEZL3.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 2040786](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vK5gEOl2UMxrKSGP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vK5gEOl2UMxrKSGP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vK5gEOl2UMxrKSGP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vK5gEOl2UMxrKSGP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vK5gEOl2UMxrKSGP.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 2040787](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZHOT2jcrYeRLjs14.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZHOT2jcrYeRLjs14.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZHOT2jcrYeRLjs14.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZHOT2jcrYeRLjs14.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZHOT2jcrYeRLjs14.full -->\n\n## 5. Give the coating time to set\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not touch the surface for 8-12 hours in order to allow the coating to bond to the surface.\n> **Note:** For best results, apply the coating before bedtime, so it has all night to bond.\n- Afterward, you can wipe off any residue remaining on the touch screen with a clean microfiber cloth.\n- Repeat this process 2-3 times to fully maximize the oleophobic coating performance and film durability.\n![Step 5 Image 2040788](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OkJmnSk5dWWwhaMk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OkJmnSk5dWWwhaMk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OkJmnSk5dWWwhaMk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OkJmnSk5dWWwhaMk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OkJmnSk5dWWwhaMk.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDone properly, this results in a perfect oleophobic coating on your device.\n\nYour device will still collect some fingerprints, but the oil left behind by your fingers will be greatly reduced, and easier to wipe off.\n\nReapply the coating every 1-2 months or as needed.",

        "raw_content": "# Wire Stripping\n\nWire needs to be exposed from its insulation in order before it can be soldered to another wire. Wire stripping exposes the wire so you are able to make good connections.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Match your gauge of wire to the gauge on a wire stripper.\n> **Note:** Some wire strippers will have two gauge sizes for the same hole, one for solid wire and one for stranded. Make sure you use the right one for the wire you are stripping!\n![Step 1 Image 203582](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWvSuS3SbA6VUdji.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWvSuS3SbA6VUdji.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWvSuS3SbA6VUdji.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWvSuS3SbA6VUdji.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OWvSuS3SbA6VUdji.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Place the wire stripper about a 1/4” from the end of the wire and squeeze down.\n> **Note:** You can strip more than 1/4\" at a time, but the effort becomes harder. About 1/2-5/8\" (13-16 mm) is the most you should probably attempt.\n![Step 2 Image 203581](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UxCKbDnTHmIhDgld.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UxCKbDnTHmIhDgld.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UxCKbDnTHmIhDgld.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UxCKbDnTHmIhDgld.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UxCKbDnTHmIhDgld.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- While squeezing, pull the stripper toward the end of the wire. This should expose some of the wire by removing its insulation.\n![Step 3 Image 203583](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iWYfbFf3XMeQ4YIr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iWYfbFf3XMeQ4YIr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iWYfbFf3XMeQ4YIr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iWYfbFf3XMeQ4YIr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iWYfbFf3XMeQ4YIr.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter your wire has been stripped, the exposed wire is ready to be soldered and reconnected to other parts of the microphone.",

        "raw_content": "# Convert PDF to JPEG, BMP, PNG and TIFF file formats\n\nWhile thinking of converting pdf file to image format on a Mac system, you lacks the support of an efficient software tool for such requirements. We have underwent this situation several times where we utmost require the help of a converter utility which can easily convert the pages of a large PDF file into popular image formats such as JPEG and BMP. Obviously, with proper resources in hand one can easily end up preparing the most professional and attractive PPT for any core group meeting. Today with the help of such utility, I'll share the steps on how to convert a PDF to image format.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Download Stellar Phoenix PDF to Image Converter Mac, install & launch the app. http://www.stellarinfo.com/mac-software/convert-pdf-to-image-for-mac.php\n![Step 1 Image 214822](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lxUpVi13yOLr4ZvR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lxUpVi13yOLr4ZvR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lxUpVi13yOLr4ZvR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lxUpVi13yOLr4ZvR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lxUpVi13yOLr4ZvR.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Click the option ''''Select File'''' to load a desired PDF file for conversion. Alternatively, if you have forgotten the exact path of the PDF file saved on Mac, then the tool provides an option ''''Find Files'''', which in turn will look for the PDF files in particular volume.\n![Step 2 Image 214819](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/26Q3TllhHRqnJJtv.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/26Q3TllhHRqnJJtv.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/26Q3TllhHRqnJJtv.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/26Q3TllhHRqnJJtv.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/26Q3TllhHRqnJJtv.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Once all the PDF files are uploaded on the software menu, choose the desired output images format. The PDF selected can be converted into '''JPEG, BMP, PNG and TIFF '''formats. These are wholly accepted images file formats and can be used in any project, presentation etc. All set! Proceed by clicking the ''''CONVERT'''' button.\n![Step 3 Image 214820](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqFHGURXaPDoAUCG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqFHGURXaPDoAUCG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqFHGURXaPDoAUCG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqFHGURXaPDoAUCG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HqFHGURXaPDoAUCG.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- The conversion process may takes some time, typically in minutes depending on the PDF size, no. of pages to be converted etc. After the process finishes, PDF pages converted into image files are arranged on the left pane of the software interface. Use check box to select, de-select images to save on the hard drive.\n![Step 4 Image 214821](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2QDvt4ZUigcKsPE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2QDvt4ZUigcKsPE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2QDvt4ZUigcKsPE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2QDvt4ZUigcKsPE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2QDvt4ZUigcKsPE.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",

        "raw_content": "# MacBook Pro 13\" Software: Safe Simple Customizing Replacement\n\nWhere to go to locate image files responsible for Mission control and dashboard backgrounds. Then I will show you HOW TO SAFELY AND PROPERLY CHANGE THEM!\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- As Always: Be Careful. The Files around what you are working with ARE VITAL TO YOU Operating SYSTEM and IT's UI!\n![Step 1 Image 221824](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3QlJrmoetbSDVEDp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3QlJrmoetbSDVEDp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3QlJrmoetbSDVEDp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3QlJrmoetbSDVEDp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3QlJrmoetbSDVEDp.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 221825](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZKqIMTOXMbpnSkS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZKqIMTOXMbpnSkS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZKqIMTOXMbpnSkS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZKqIMTOXMbpnSkS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZKqIMTOXMbpnSkS.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Open up Finder.\n- Navigate to your System Hard Drive               (ie: Mine is \"Macintosh HD\")\n- Open  \"SYSTEM\"\n- Open \"LIBRARY\"\n- Open \"CORE SERVICES\"\n- NOW BE CAREFUL Some of these Apps are important! Find the app \"DOCK.APP\" open the menu (right click/two finger click) and click \"SHOW PACKAGE CONTENTS\"\n- Open \"CONTENTS\"\n- AGAIN BE CAREFUL HERE!!!                             Open \"RESOURCES\"\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- The Files within this folder are very important for part of your Mac's GUI; So Only mess with the following files mentioned!\n  - \"PIRELLI.png\" & PIRELLI@2...    These files are responsible for you dashboard background and Mission Control Tab for Dashboard(if enabled)\n  - There is a set Tiling mode in the OS so selecting an image of proper size is crucial.\n  - Create a new folder called \"pirelliORIGINAL\" and place these two AND ONLY TWO files here\n  - Next Take your desired Image and rename it to \"pirelli.png\"\n  - Dimensions: I Use 2880 x1900\n  - And as shown move the image to the RESOURCES FOLDER\n![Step 3 Image 221836](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dQUgABrH1Ox2FJnV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dQUgABrH1Ox2FJnV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dQUgABrH1Ox2FJnV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dQUgABrH1Ox2FJnV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dQUgABrH1Ox2FJnV.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Now for Mission Control:\n- Same steps as before instead find the files labeled \"defaultdesktop.png\" & \" defaultdesktop@2x.png\"\n- put in a new folder labeled \"defaultdesktopORIGINAL\"\n- Chose Your Image (Make sure it is a Higher Resolution Image) and rename it to defaultdesktop.png\n- Again Drag the new image to this folder (\"RESOURCES\")\n- So the files are moved and in place, now to activate it...\n![Step 4 Image 221844](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2ULVSOy6cveygaDY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2ULVSOy6cveygaDY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2ULVSOy6cveygaDY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2ULVSOy6cveygaDY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2ULVSOy6cveygaDY.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 221842](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sGBFHYlOWDjR6BkW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sGBFHYlOWDjR6BkW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sGBFHYlOWDjR6BkW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sGBFHYlOWDjR6BkW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sGBFHYlOWDjR6BkW.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- open up your terminal\n- type the following EXACTLY (case-sensitive)      '''killall Dock'''  [press enter]\n- *You may need to have super user permissions for the step above. If so, add the word \"sudo\" before the command above. (So the whole command will read '''sudo killall Dock''')\n- 'YOU SHOULD NOW SEE YOUR NEW BACKDROPS!\"\"\n![Step 5 Image 221849](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aWqrPBpbQaQvelwv.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aWqrPBpbQaQvelwv.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aWqrPBpbQaQvelwv.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aWqrPBpbQaQvelwv.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aWqrPBpbQaQvelwv.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",

        "raw_content": "# Adding images to a new question\n\nIt seems that some of us are having trouble with adding images to questions. Images, in addition to a good description of the problem, are most helpful.\n\n***An updated version is available! [guide|21499]***\n\n***NOTE: iFixit requires you to crop or resize images if they're not captured in 4:3 format. Most modern cameras capture in 3:2 or 16:9, which will require a crop. If you change your capturing preferences when taking pictures to 4:3 you shouldn't need to crop them in the Media Manager.***\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- The first thing to do, is to click on the top right orange button \"Ask a Question\"\n- This action is going to open the question window. Here is where the device that the question pertain to is being entered, a short question, as well as the description of the problem.\n- Most devices are listed on a pick list, but can be entered by free-text as well.\n- The description of the problem should include what attempts to solve the problem have been undertaken.\n![Step 1 Image 227348](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ntER1TMXn3O3dTvX.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ntER1TMXn3O3dTvX.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ntER1TMXn3O3dTvX.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ntER1TMXn3O3dTvX.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ntER1TMXn3O3dTvX.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 227349](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xNrnxf3FQpwNvtMi.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xNrnxf3FQpwNvtMi.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xNrnxf3FQpwNvtMi.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xNrnxf3FQpwNvtMi.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xNrnxf3FQpwNvtMi.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 227351](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NYJ4LMShnJ6L6eZn.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NYJ4LMShnJ6L6eZn.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NYJ4LMShnJ6L6eZn.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NYJ4LMShnJ6L6eZn.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NYJ4LMShnJ6L6eZn.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Once the text has been filled out and images are to be placed with the question, click on the orange \"Image\" tab on the bottom left hand corner.\n- This opens an approximately quarter screen size window with an upload symbol. This particular window may be empty, or it may have multiple images already present. This depends on if one has previously posted images. This is where the images are stored until they are going to be posted.\n- To open the import image dialog, click the \"Upload Icon\", this will open up a upload dialog window. From here images can be either placed into the question, by \"drag&drop\", only if they are already in the image repository. Most of the time it will require using the \"Browse Files\" icon. .\n  - When it is clicked on, it will access the users computer and list the directories\n![Step 2 Image 227369](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/COZFoMFrdbjgNQJW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/COZFoMFrdbjgNQJW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/COZFoMFrdbjgNQJW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/COZFoMFrdbjgNQJW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/COZFoMFrdbjgNQJW.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 227370](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atHm1TsFFhCiDBMb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atHm1TsFFhCiDBMb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atHm1TsFFhCiDBMb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atHm1TsFFhCiDBMb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atHm1TsFFhCiDBMb.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 227372](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11iGoGvp5yYVVs1O.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11iGoGvp5yYVVs1O.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11iGoGvp5yYVVs1O.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11iGoGvp5yYVVs1O.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11iGoGvp5yYVVs1O.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Choose the directory that contains the image to be imported. It is possible to select multiple images at once. Hold the \"Ctrl\" key down and left click on individual image files allow for this.\n- Once the file(s) is selected, click the \"open\" key. This will now upload the file to the image repository. Once the file(s) is uploaded, it will show in the repository.\n- With the file showing in the bottom window, left '''click and hold''' on the image. Then drag the image into the question text window. This action will be noticeable since the background of the question text window changes. Release the left mouse button once the cursor is in the question text window.\n  - The image will be placed at the last cursor position. Ensure that the cursor is, where the image is supposed to be placed, before dragging it into the question text box.\n![Step 3 Image 227377](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y3DFLMHWNBYSRMTT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y3DFLMHWNBYSRMTT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y3DFLMHWNBYSRMTT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y3DFLMHWNBYSRMTT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/y3DFLMHWNBYSRMTT.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 227379](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3YwWUByLENTE1VWu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3YwWUByLENTE1VWu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3YwWUByLENTE1VWu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3YwWUByLENTE1VWu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3YwWUByLENTE1VWu.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 227381](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jfN253Npu6oUnEwD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jfN253Npu6oUnEwD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jfN253Npu6oUnEwD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jfN253Npu6oUnEwD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jfN253Npu6oUnEwD.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Once the image was dragged to the question, it will show up as a number in the text box, but can be viewed in the preview. The image will now have been removed out of the repository as well.\n  - Close the upload image window by clicking on the orange \"Image\" tab. If the position of the image, as well as the description of the problem is satisfactory, click the orange \"Ask it\" tab. This will post the question with the image.\n![Step 4 Image 227383](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yIU1mGwO1V3dhjDN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yIU1mGwO1V3dhjDN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yIU1mGwO1V3dhjDN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yIU1mGwO1V3dhjDN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yIU1mGwO1V3dhjDN.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHope this helps, good luck.",

This will show how to add those images. The procedure is the same to add images to existing questions.\n\nA [guide|21499|newer version of this guide exists here].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- To get into the Edit window, click the \"Edit\" link\n- The edit window is now open. Click on the orange \"Images\" tab in the bottom left corner\n- This opens an approximately quarter screen size window with am upload symbol. This particular window may be empty, or it may have multiple images already present. This depends on if one has previously posted images. This is where the images are stored until they are going to be posted.\n![Step 1 Image 227446](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2jOYOLDBunvEsAMU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2jOYOLDBunvEsAMU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2jOYOLDBunvEsAMU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2jOYOLDBunvEsAMU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2jOYOLDBunvEsAMU.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 227447](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NRYk2xFPkbiZdRVY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NRYk2xFPkbiZdRVY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NRYk2xFPkbiZdRVY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NRYk2xFPkbiZdRVY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NRYk2xFPkbiZdRVY.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 227448](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/F6Z4FvJwKTiucYIS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/F6Z4FvJwKTiucYIS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/F6Z4FvJwKTiucYIS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/F6Z4FvJwKTiucYIS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/F6Z4FvJwKTiucYIS.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- To open the import image dialog, click the \"Upload Icon\", this will open up a upload dialog window. From here images can be either placed into the question, by \"drag&drop\", only if they are already in the image repository. Most of the time it will require using the \"Browse Files\" icon. .\n- When it is clicked on, it will access the users computer and list the directories. Choose the directory that contains the image to be imported. It is possible to select multiple images at once. Hold the \"Ctrl\" key down and left click on individual image files allow for this.\n- Once the file(s) is selected, click the \"open\" key. This will now upload the file to the image repository. Once the file(s) is uploaded, it will show in the repository.\n![Step 2 Image 227451](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KW5lpZjcWrowqxGL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KW5lpZjcWrowqxGL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KW5lpZjcWrowqxGL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KW5lpZjcWrowqxGL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KW5lpZjcWrowqxGL.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 227452](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1tYokSnLRKy1NRvy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1tYokSnLRKy1NRvy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1tYokSnLRKy1NRvy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1tYokSnLRKy1NRvy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1tYokSnLRKy1NRvy.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 227453](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FCBoiLkSi1dZeMwp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FCBoiLkSi1dZeMwp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FCBoiLkSi1dZeMwp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FCBoiLkSi1dZeMwp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FCBoiLkSi1dZeMwp.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- With the file showing in the bottom window, left click and hold on the image. Then drag the image into the question text window. This action will be noticeable since the background of the edit text window changes. Release the left mouse button once the cursor is in the question text window.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** The image will be placed at the last cursor position. Ensure that the cursor is, where the image is supposed to be placed, before dragging it into the question text box.\n- Once the image is dragged to the question, it will show up as a number in the edit text box, but can be viewed in the preview. The image will now have been removed out of the repository as well.\n- Close the upload image window by clicking on the orange \"Image\" tab. If the position of the image, as well as the rest of the edit is satisfactory, click the orange \"Submit revision\" tab. This will post the edited answer with the image.\n![Step 3 Image 227454](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qZ13jcU6jYSZJ2Mi.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qZ13jcU6jYSZJ2Mi.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qZ13jcU6jYSZJ2Mi.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qZ13jcU6jYSZJ2Mi.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qZ13jcU6jYSZJ2Mi.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 227455](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wJMFKH652ZPGWeAN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wJMFKH652ZPGWeAN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wJMFKH652ZPGWeAN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wJMFKH652ZPGWeAN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wJMFKH652ZPGWeAN.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 227456](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WAaTsew5U2OOiS4m.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WAaTsew5U2OOiS4m.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WAaTsew5U2OOiS4m.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WAaTsew5U2OOiS4m.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WAaTsew5U2OOiS4m.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHope this helps, good luck",

        "raw_content": "# How to Remove a Stripped Screw\n\nStripped screws are a nightmare for any repair enthusiast. Try as you might, some screws just do not want to come out. Frustration takes over and before you know it, that once \"+\" shape has turned into a \"O\". Never fear; we've got your back. This guide will walk you through how to use a rotary tool to remove a stripped screw by cutting a small slit in the screw head, allowing you to remove the screw with a flathead screwdriver.\n\nTechniques:\n\n# [guide|13213|Different Screwdriver|stepid=45159]\n# [guide|13213|Rubber Band|stepid=98920]\n# [guide|13213|Screw Extracting Pliers|stepid=98921]\n# [guide|13213|Superglue|stepid=98935]\n# [guide|13213|Rotary Tool|stepid=45160]\n***Always wear safety goggles when using a rotary tool to prevent injury from debris or sparks.***\n\n[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEZyUzt8xys]\n\n## 1. Use a different screwdriver\n- Your screw is stripped, and your screwdriver is no longer sufficient. Before busting out the heavy hitters, try the following:\n  - Use different screwdrivers. First try slightly smaller or larger head sizes, then a flat head screwdriver, to see if you can get it to catch on some part of the stripped screw.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** If the bit doesn't catch the screw instantly, do not continue. Otherwise, you run the risk of further stripping the screw.\n- If either of these techniques are fruitful, congrats! Your screw is free.\n![Step 1 Image 590387](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/V6MTNFApWDrKHgNg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/V6MTNFApWDrKHgNg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/V6MTNFApWDrKHgNg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/V6MTNFApWDrKHgNg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/V6MTNFApWDrKHgNg.full -->\n\n## 2. Use a rubber band\n> **Note:** A rubber band can give you the extra grip you need.\n- Stretch a rubber band over the stripped screw.\n> **Note:** You can also use a thin piece of fabric.\n- Insert a properly-sized screwdriver, and give it a turn.\n![Step 2 Image 590455](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFtcMtdYHt1vjLou.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFtcMtdYHt1vjLou.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFtcMtdYHt1vjLou.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFtcMtdYHt1vjLou.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/oFtcMtdYHt1vjLou.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 590456](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FaeEb6oX1RQRbpjR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FaeEb6oX1RQRbpjR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FaeEb6oX1RQRbpjR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FaeEb6oX1RQRbpjR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FaeEb6oX1RQRbpjR.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 590454](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PjgUmyMDCfyMWYBy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PjgUmyMDCfyMWYBy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PjgUmyMDCfyMWYBy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PjgUmyMDCfyMWYBy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PjgUmyMDCfyMWYBy.full -->\n\n## 3. Use a pair of pliers\n- If the screw head is accessible, try a pair of [product|IF145-127|screw extracting pliers]. If you can get a good grip, turn the pliers and the screw should turn along with it!\n- Once the screw is loosened a bit, you can probably back it out the rest of the way using a screwdriver.\n![Step 3 Image 590458](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MwGbj4fiN6k62vcQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MwGbj4fiN6k62vcQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MwGbj4fiN6k62vcQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MwGbj4fiN6k62vcQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MwGbj4fiN6k62vcQ.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 590457](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wsvJRMkHTiXA6Gs2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wsvJRMkHTiXA6Gs2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wsvJRMkHTiXA6Gs2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wsvJRMkHTiXA6Gs2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wsvJRMkHTiXA6Gs2.full -->\n\n## 4. Use glue\n- Still stuck? Try adding a dab of superglue to the top of the screw.\n- Set your driver into the screw head, and allow the glue to dry.\n- Using a firm grip and downward pressure, give the driver a twist to remove the screw.\n> **Note:** Don't forget to clean the remains of the glue from the tip of your driver.\n![Step 4 Image 590761](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TLRvyaXx1o2XtAA5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TLRvyaXx1o2XtAA5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TLRvyaXx1o2XtAA5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TLRvyaXx1o2XtAA5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TLRvyaXx1o2XtAA5.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 590762](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/p1aFCPYmJKvNUMWF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/p1aFCPYmJKvNUMWF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/p1aFCPYmJKvNUMWF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/p1aFCPYmJKvNUMWF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/p1aFCPYmJKvNUMWF.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 590763](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BuAB56HRAXZPPsIa.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BuAB56HRAXZPPsIa.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BuAB56HRAXZPPsIa.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BuAB56HRAXZPPsIa.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BuAB56HRAXZPPsIa.full -->\n\n## 5. Use a rotary tool\n> **Note:** If you were unable to remove the screw with screwdrivers, pliers, a rubber band, or super glue, then a rotary tool should do the trick.\n- Attach a thin cutting disk to your rotary tool. Before you cut anything, make sure the disk is secured well.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Make sure you wear protective goggles anytime you use a rotary tool to prevent injuries from flying debris and sparks.\n![Step 5 Image 590388](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tef1h3PCbFZfHnvJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tef1h3PCbFZfHnvJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tef1h3PCbFZfHnvJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tef1h3PCbFZfHnvJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Tef1h3PCbFZfHnvJ.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n> **Note:** In this step, you will use the rotary tool to make a thin cut in the stripped screw that enables you to use a flathead screwdriver to remove the screw.\n> **Note:** We recommend using a low power setting (we used 2 out of 6) to prevent damaging the rest of the device or the screw.\n> **Note:** You want the cut to be deep enough that you can fit a flathead screwdriver into it, but thin enough that the screwdriver has something to grip.\n- Make a single thin cut into the head of the stripped screw.\n![Step 6 Image 590391](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JbdZJyNZgtsAFyq4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JbdZJyNZgtsAFyq4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JbdZJyNZgtsAFyq4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JbdZJyNZgtsAFyq4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/JbdZJyNZgtsAFyq4.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 590389](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOpMJcaWsVS6qQk2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOpMJcaWsVS6qQk2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOpMJcaWsVS6qQk2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOpMJcaWsVS6qQk2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOpMJcaWsVS6qQk2.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Use a flathead screwdriver to remove the screw from the device.\n  - The size of the driver will depend on the size of the screw, but use the largest size that will fit in your cut.\n> **Note:** If you cannot fit a screwdriver into the cut, use the rotary tool to make the cut larger. Make only small cuts; if you cut off too much of the screw, a screwdriver will not catch and you will not be able to twist the screw.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Wear eye protection and give your device a few good blasts of compressed air before reassembling it. The rotary tool can scatter loose metal shavings around the device, creating the potential for an electrical short if not blown clear.\n![Step 7 Image 590390](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VbU2XLEhZQ5qcRDW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VbU2XLEhZQ5qcRDW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VbU2XLEhZQ5qcRDW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VbU2XLEhZQ5qcRDW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VbU2XLEhZQ5qcRDW.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nCheck out the video in the intro for some additional tips on dealing with stripped screws.

Some have even claimed that we love one juicy snack more than [guide|811|others|new_window=true].\n\nNo more. To show some appreciation towards other members of the fruit family, we decided to test out the accessibility, repairability, and end-of-life design of the Orange.\n\nTried the teardown at home with mild to moderate success?  Celebrate with an '''[product|IF145-223|Orange Teardown t-shirt]'''! Or if you're having technical difficulties with your Orange, make sure you've [[Orange Identification Guide|identified your Orange]] correctly, and then visit our [[Orange Troubleshooting|Orange Troubleshooting Guide]] to figure out what's going on. Perhaps you just need the [product|IF145-221|right tool] for the job.\n\nWant to know more about how we juiced this Orange? Read the full behind-the-scenes account on the '''[http://ifixit.org/4445/orange-teardown-behind-the-peel/|iFixit blog|new_window=true]'''.\n\nCheck out all the latest fruits of our labor by following [link|http://www.twitter.com/ifixit|iFixit] on Twitter or \"Liking\" us on [link|http://www.facebook.com/iFixit|Facebook].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- The Orange. Nature's mysterious orange sphere. Believed to be the hybrid between a pomelo and a mandarin, the Orange is a staple food that has been cultivated since ancient times.\n- So what components make up this juicy device? Here are the tech specs:\n  - Orange peel\n  - Orange seeds\n  - Orange pith\n  - Orange pulp\n  - Orange juice\n  - Orange color (corresponding to a 620 nm wavelength)\n![Step 1 Image 233720](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6Iy6KWux6MZxdaFv.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6Iy6KWux6MZxdaFv.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6Iy6KWux6MZxdaFv.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6Iy6KWux6MZxdaFv.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6Iy6KWux6MZxdaFv.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 233090](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4bMN4Grt2mPaGTBf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4bMN4Grt2mPaGTBf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4bMN4Grt2mPaGTBf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4bMN4Grt2mPaGTBf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4bMN4Grt2mPaGTBf.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Before we could start penetrating the thick outer peel protecting the Orange's sweet innards, this [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/10/11|small|new_window=true] [http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2003/6/4/|mechanoid|new_window=true] appeared out of thin air. Cue [http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=unZjBx5X0hA#t=24s|Final Fantasy battle theme|new_window=true].\n- After a protracted tussle, the Orange emerged victorious. The fate of the mechanoid is unknown—it vanished mysteriously into the arcane shadows from whence it came.\n- Strike a pose; Juxtapose. We set up our customary comparison shot to contrast the Orange to an [http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/T13ywXMbsLFkZmta.large|Apple|new_window=true].\n![Step 2 Image 233087](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IP3xhJyBLLupZEiI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IP3xhJyBLLupZEiI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IP3xhJyBLLupZEiI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IP3xhJyBLLupZEiI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IP3xhJyBLLupZEiI.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 233312](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ciVhTXhR2reAnIE3.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ciVhTXhR2reAnIE3.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ciVhTXhR2reAnIE3.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ciVhTXhR2reAnIE3.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ciVhTXhR2reAnIE3.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- What exactly adheres the outer layer to the Orange? We aren't really sure. We're familiar with how much adhesive [guide|8277|devices these days|stepid=33139|new_window=true] employ and are prepared to act accordingly.\n- In any case, the only sure-fire way to know is to heat the Orange up with our [product|IF145-031|heat gun|new_window=true]. This has never been done in the history of Orange disassembly. This truly is one small step for an Orange, one giant leap for fruitkind.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not attempt this procedure at home.

Step 4\n- At this point, we are fairly confident that the heat gun sufficiently loosened any adhesive in the Orange. Time to get to the tearing down!\n- To our surprise, our [http://xkcd.com/55/|normal approach|new_window=true] does not seem to apply to this strange device.\n![Step 4 Image 233096](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3XRQxJYMwklOs1DM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3XRQxJYMwklOs1DM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3XRQxJYMwklOs1DM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3XRQxJYMwklOs1DM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3XRQxJYMwklOs1DM.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 233094](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OTWLxlULJiiZAgWf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OTWLxlULJiiZAgWf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OTWLxlULJiiZAgWf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OTWLxlULJiiZAgWf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OTWLxlULJiiZAgWf.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 233093](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SXEZetDWepYJPOcA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SXEZetDWepYJPOcA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SXEZetDWepYJPOcA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SXEZetDWepYJPOcA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SXEZetDWepYJPOcA.full -->\n\n## 5.

Step 6\n- Having no luck with our vast array of poking, prodding, and prying tools, we figure a little more heat might be necessary.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Turns out keeping a heat gun on the same spot for too long will damage the outer layer of the peel beyond repair. If you're not extremely cautious, you will find yourself in need of a new outer peel.\n> **Note:** We stood in line at the local [http://goo.gl/maps/SqRV2|Orange Store|new_window=true] for hours to get a whole heap of Oranges, so hopefully we'll have a fool-proof method to open them by the time we start writing repair guides.\n![Step 6 Image 233097](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SnJ4WfcfH6CvcKJr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SnJ4WfcfH6CvcKJr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SnJ4WfcfH6CvcKJr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SnJ4WfcfH6CvcKJr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SnJ4WfcfH6CvcKJr.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 233098](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mUcwZ2gZqercUruE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mUcwZ2gZqercUruE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mUcwZ2gZqercUruE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mUcwZ2gZqercUruE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mUcwZ2gZqercUruE.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- With no other option in sight, we turn to our last resort for impossible-to-open devices: the [product|IF145-096|Pentalobe screwdriver|new_window=true].\n- [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070996/|Phooey|new_window=true]!

Step 9\n- We quickly get to work slicing through the Orange's thick peel with the oOpener, spiraling down like whirlybirds in the breeze.\n- Having the right tool for the job is a truly heartwarming experience.

Step 11\n- It took us ten steps, but we finally managed to penetrate the impenetrable.\n- As an added bonus, the Orange comes with a free accessory, the Orange Peel—an amusing, Slinky-like contraption, guaranteed to deliver hours of fun.\n![Step 11 Image 233112](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dG6kt5OY6EX2bjJo.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dG6kt5OY6EX2bjJo.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dG6kt5OY6EX2bjJo.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dG6kt5OY6EX2bjJo.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dG6kt5OY6EX2bjJo.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 233120](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DGFBkptZVSmn4pwR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DGFBkptZVSmn4pwR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DGFBkptZVSmn4pwR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DGFBkptZVSmn4pwR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DGFBkptZVSmn4pwR.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 233121](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/paJUqlegITPRAjaY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/paJUqlegITPRAjaY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/paJUqlegITPRAjaY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/paJUqlegITPRAjaY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/paJUqlegITPRAjaY.full -->\n\n## 12. Step 12\n- ''Results may vary. Your Orange Peel may not actually look like a Slinky. Do not try to use Peel as a Slinky. Do not try to use Peel as any form of toy. Do not give Peel to children. Consult a doctor if you feel that your Orange Peel is not Slinky-y enough. ''\n\n## 13. Step 13\n- Now that we've removed the rind, let's take a brief scientific look at the make-up of the Orange in the first ever segment of '''Fruit Science with iFixit!'''\n- Oranges and other citrus fruits are of the order Hesperidium—a kind of berry with a tough, leathery rind.\n- The three important layers of such fruits are the exocarp (rind), mesocarp (pith), and endocarp (the delicious edible part).\n![Step 13 Image 233216](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vJXFt4AmBSViTwLI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vJXFt4AmBSViTwLI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vJXFt4AmBSViTwLI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vJXFt4AmBSViTwLI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vJXFt4AmBSViTwLI.full -->\n![Step 13 Image 233201](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDGdFTuwdEbBLB5r.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDGdFTuwdEbBLB5r.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDGdFTuwdEbBLB5r.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDGdFTuwdEbBLB5r.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDGdFTuwdEbBLB5r.full -->\n\n## 14. Step 14\n- One final obstacle stands between us and sectioning the Orange into its component wedges.\n- Gentle prying with a plastic opening tool separates the navel, freeing up the top of the Orange for separation.\n- This appears to be yet another irreversible step; the Orange's repairability score will likely take another hit.\n![Step 14 Image 233123](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uATHAk2lZJYsLvRL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uATHAk2lZJYsLvRL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uATHAk2lZJYsLvRL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uATHAk2lZJYsLvRL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/uATHAk2lZJYsLvRL.full -->\n\n## 15. Step 15\n- We notice the resistance of some natural adhesive as we slowly pull the Orange apart.\n- It appears that if you are not careful enough whilst pulling the Orange apart, you will tear the sectional membranes of the Orange.\n![Step 15 Image 233125](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfAdIZnnhOojr6t6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfAdIZnnhOojr6t6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfAdIZnnhOojr6t6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfAdIZnnhOojr6t6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tfAdIZnnhOojr6t6.full -->\n![Step 15 Image 233126](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mTJhcJFLrtVQEFag.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mTJhcJFLrtVQEFag.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mTJhcJFLrtVQEFag.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mTJhcJFLrtVQEFag.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mTJhcJFLrtVQEFag.full -->\n![Step 15 Image 233127](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IBQS2oSxCFMc4B1n.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IBQS2oSxCFMc4B1n.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IBQS2oSxCFMc4B1n.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IBQS2oSxCFMc4B1n.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IBQS2oSxCFMc4B1n.full -->\n\n## 16. Step 16\n- We love modular devices, and this one is as modular as they come. Having modular components makes replacing each component a lot ~~tastier~~ easier.\n- All ten major internal components of this device are easily removable. However, we are worried that they might not go back together as easily as they come apart, a common problem in fruit repair.\n- Though the Orange's repairability is highly questionable, we do admire its end-of-life design. It is completely recyclable, compostable, and delicious-able. We hope that devices like this will some day [http://youtu.be/ZN5PoW7_kdA?t=4s|catch the attention|new_window=true] of other device manufacturers and help keep electronics out of landfills…unless they are compostable, of course!\n![Step 16 Image 233129](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EJqKWXSkgaACboXq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EJqKWXSkgaACboXq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EJqKWXSkgaACboXq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EJqKWXSkgaACboXq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EJqKWXSkgaACboXq.full -->\n![Step 16 Image 233130](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/i6yP1eV3WfhA6KQb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/i6yP1eV3WfhA6KQb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/i6yP1eV3WfhA6KQb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/i6yP1eV3WfhA6KQb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/i6yP1eV3WfhA6KQb.full -->\n![Step 16 Image 233131](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SVDeeyFFPdZfrLdS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SVDeeyFFPdZfrLdS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SVDeeyFFPdZfrLdS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SVDeeyFFPdZfrLdS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SVDeeyFFPdZfrLdS.full -->\n\n## 17. Step 17\n- Sectioning the left half reveals another component: the central column of the Orange.\n> **Note:** The central column is a structural build-up of pith, the mesocarp layer of the Orange's body.\n- Turning a wedge over reveals more of the pithy mesocarp. Its utility is currently unknown; we suspect possibly EMI shielding?\n![Step 17 Image 233132](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DoJbRUrbltJom2r2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DoJbRUrbltJom2r2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DoJbRUrbltJom2r2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DoJbRUrbltJom2r2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DoJbRUrbltJom2r2.full -->\n![Step 17 Image 233134](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/igQCTaQi4oPFkUtJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/igQCTaQi4oPFkUtJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/igQCTaQi4oPFkUtJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/igQCTaQi4oPFkUtJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/igQCTaQi4oPFkUtJ.full -->\n![Step 17 Image 233133](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/P6cBHvxueY5JqTfP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/P6cBHvxueY5JqTfP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/P6cBHvxueY5JqTfP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/P6cBHvxueY5JqTfP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/P6cBHvxueY5JqTfP.full -->\n\n## 18. Step 18\n- It's time to unlock the deeper mysteries of the Orange.\n- Unlike some of our [guide|10528|more complicated teardowns|new_window=true], a steady hand and a [product|IF145-185|sharp blade|new_window=true] are the only tools we need to get a view of a section's internal structure.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** This may puncture the Orange's interior cells, causing acidic adhesive leakage.

Repairability will definitely take a hit for this one.\n- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_(fruit)#Navel_oranges|Navel] Oranges, such as this, have small, sterile seeds that cannot be used to reproduce more Oranges—a cutting from an existing fruit-bearing tree must be grafted to another tree.\n> **Note:** This is the most advanced anti-piracy DRM measure we've seen, definitively ensuring that Orange owners won't be able to produce copies of their Orange to share with their friends.\n  - We assume the device is supported by [http://www.orange.com/en/home|Orange Mobile]  but it remains to be seen if it will be released to [http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000eG2kHZXxbxI/s/750/750/CARRYING-ORANGES.jpg|other carriers] in the future.\n![Step 19 Image 233203](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RvQKZogjXLsXlM1P.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RvQKZogjXLsXlM1P.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RvQKZogjXLsXlM1P.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RvQKZogjXLsXlM1P.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RvQKZogjXLsXlM1P.full -->\n![Step 19 Image 233194](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YICZOcSOoATOncsN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YICZOcSOoATOncsN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YICZOcSOoATOncsN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YICZOcSOoATOncsN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YICZOcSOoATOncsN.full -->\n\n## 20.

        "raw_content": "# How to Clone an Existing Drive\n\nThis guide will go through the process of cloning your existing software, OS, and data to a new hard drive.\n\n(SuperDuper is now compatible with Big Sur & Monterey.)\n\n***NOTE:*** With the introduction of macOS Catalina, certain steps in this guide are out of date.\n\n***''IMPORTANT: Cloning the hard drive is not recommended''*** ''if you have a Mac that uses a  recovery partition (MacOS 10.7 - present) or internet recovery (2011 - present). Instead, to move your data to a new drive, first [guide|119046|create a backup of your existing drive|new_window=true]. Then, either use [guide|119499|internet recovery|new_window=true] or [guide|66371|create a bootable external drive|new_window=true] so you’ll be ready to install macOS onto your new drive and migrate your data afterward.''\n\nIf you are happy with your existing operating system installation and would simply like to upgrade your hard drive capacity, you can clone your existing hard drive to your new drive.\n\nTo clone a hard drive, you will need a way to connect the second hard drive to your Mac. Our [product|IF107-152|2.5\" Hard Drive Enclosure|new_window=true] or one of our [product|IF107-143-2|Hard Drive Upgrade Kits|new_window=true] works great for cloning your drive over.\n\nTo clone your hard drive, we recommend a program called [link|http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html|SuperDuper!], by Shirt Pocket Software.\n\nThe following instructions assume that you’ll be using SuperDuper! and the 2.5\" hard drive enclosure to clone onto a new 2.5\" drive. If you are using a different setup, your installation process may be somewhat different.\n\n## 1. Install the drive into the enclosure\n> **Note:** Before you begin, look at your hard drive's ports and make sure that it has the right connectors:\n  - Narrow data port\n  - Wide power port\n![Step 1 Image 2081985](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4JhGoJe32DvBABcV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4JhGoJe32DvBABcV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4JhGoJe32DvBABcV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4JhGoJe32DvBABcV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4JhGoJe32DvBABcV.full -->\n\n## 2. Open the enclosure\n- Use the included screwdriver to remove the two Phillips screws.\n![Step 2 Image 2082016](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l5LZ15iFvLKSgKkj.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l5LZ15iFvLKSgKkj.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l5LZ15iFvLKSgKkj.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l5LZ15iFvLKSgKkj.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l5LZ15iFvLKSgKkj.full -->\n\n## 3.

Install the SSD\n- Set the drive in the plastic tray and align the drive ports with the tray socket.\n> **Note:** To prevent strain on the enclosure socket, lay the drive as flat against the tray as possible.\n- Carefully push the drive into the tray socket to seat the ports.\n- Press the drive's raised edge down into the plastic tray.\n> **Note:** If the drive edge catches on the foam block, the drive is not fully seated against the tray socket. Continue pressing the drive into the socket until it clears the foam block.\n![Step 4 Image 2082006](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HEDUVFyoyHCPjZQG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HEDUVFyoyHCPjZQG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HEDUVFyoyHCPjZQG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HEDUVFyoyHCPjZQG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HEDUVFyoyHCPjZQG.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 2082008](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yG2mwjvGE4BUJmEU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yG2mwjvGE4BUJmEU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yG2mwjvGE4BUJmEU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yG2mwjvGE4BUJmEU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/yG2mwjvGE4BUJmEU.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 2082014](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bHqdPvQVNkFSCtrl.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bHqdPvQVNkFSCtrl.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bHqdPvQVNkFSCtrl.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bHqdPvQVNkFSCtrl.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bHqdPvQVNkFSCtrl.full -->\n\n## 5.

We’re using a Bernina 830 for this procedure; sewing machines can vary, so check your sewing machine's owner’s manual for specific instructions.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Set the sewing machine needle to the upright position by turning the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Balance_Wheel|balance wheel]] towards you.\n- Release the presser foot lever by sliding it up.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** The presser foot will just fall out. Be ready to grab it.\n![Step 1 Image 293993](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ygqo6UGSCAvXNBcc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ygqo6UGSCAvXNBcc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ygqo6UGSCAvXNBcc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ygqo6UGSCAvXNBcc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ygqo6UGSCAvXNBcc.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 293995](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUP4BV1NI2ISEpEg.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUP4BV1NI2ISEpEg.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUP4BV1NI2ISEpEg.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUP4BV1NI2ISEpEg.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WUP4BV1NI2ISEpEg.full -->\n\n## 2.

        "raw_content": "# Creating a Buttonhole Using a Sewing Machine\n\nUse this guide to create a buttonhole with your sewing machine. We’re using a Bernina 830, but the process should be similar for all sewing machines with a mechanical buttonhole dial. Since every sewing machine is different, refer to your sewing machine’s owner’s manual for specific information. In this guide we’re using contrasting thread for visibility. When it comes time for your actual project, you’ll want to use thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Select your [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Buttonhole_Foot|buttonhole foot]]. Buttonhole feet can vary in appearance, so check you manual.\n- Thread the buttonhole foot by sliding the thread through the diagonal slit into the center hole.\n![Step 1 Image 293994](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBY6ePTegroWaVTI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBY6ePTegroWaVTI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBY6ePTegroWaVTI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBY6ePTegroWaVTI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBY6ePTegroWaVTI.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 293997](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZYwcs2nXULiDm2FI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZYwcs2nXULiDm2FI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZYwcs2nXULiDm2FI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZYwcs2nXULiDm2FI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZYwcs2nXULiDm2FI.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Mark where you would like the top and bottom of the buttonhole to be with tailor's chalk.\n> **Note:** You can measure your button if you aren't sure.\n- Align the sewing machine at the upper left corner of the buttonhole.\n![Step 2 Image 294000](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YZS5GdxvSPniOxh1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YZS5GdxvSPniOxh1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YZS5GdxvSPniOxh1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YZS5GdxvSPniOxh1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YZS5GdxvSPniOxh1.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294003](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rh6OUUQAagLhWIUU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rh6OUUQAagLhWIUU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rh6OUUQAagLhWIUU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rh6OUUQAagLhWIUU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rh6OUUQAagLhWIUU.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Lower the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Presser_Foot|presser foot]].\n![Step 3 Image 294006](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/srvUTShOrvvHiXVZ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/srvUTShOrvvHiXVZ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/srvUTShOrvvHiXVZ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/srvUTShOrvvHiXVZ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/srvUTShOrvvHiXVZ.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294009](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Lv1weYPCXCZNOCoD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Lv1weYPCXCZNOCoD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Lv1weYPCXCZNOCoD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Lv1weYPCXCZNOCoD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Lv1weYPCXCZNOCoD.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Set your stitch length dial to nearly zero, this will create a satin stitch. The usual stitch length is around the 2.5.\n![Step 4 Image 294013](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WYDlr4AlPtkTUeC3.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WYDlr4AlPtkTUeC3.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WYDlr4AlPtkTUeC3.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WYDlr4AlPtkTUeC3.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WYDlr4AlPtkTUeC3.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294015](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VvapflBLfkaCitSE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VvapflBLfkaCitSE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VvapflBLfkaCitSE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VvapflBLfkaCitSE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VvapflBLfkaCitSE.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Set your button hole dial to one. If you have an electronic sewing machine, refer to your manual.\n> **Note:** Every time you adjust this dial, your needle will move. That's okay; it's supposed to do that.\n- Start sewing. Sew to your second line.\n![Step 5 Image 294019](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIGTN42udbNespoh.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIGTN42udbNespoh.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIGTN42udbNespoh.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIGTN42udbNespoh.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VIGTN42udbNespoh.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294020](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lBISdF4O4DjevA2g.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lBISdF4O4DjevA2g.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lBISdF4O4DjevA2g.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lBISdF4O4DjevA2g.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lBISdF4O4DjevA2g.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294021](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UaYDAHQLEKtspdQf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UaYDAHQLEKtspdQf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UaYDAHQLEKtspdQf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UaYDAHQLEKtspdQf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UaYDAHQLEKtspdQf.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Set your button hole dial to two.\n- Sew the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Bar_Tack|bar tack]] at the bottom of the buttonhole.\n> **Note:** Setting the button hole dial to two tells your sewing machine what to do, all you need to do is sew a few stitches to create the bar tack.\n![Step 6 Image 294025](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6x3QE3ROaBYqUilT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6x3QE3ROaBYqUilT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6x3QE3ROaBYqUilT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6x3QE3ROaBYqUilT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6x3QE3ROaBYqUilT.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294027](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tHnFGZtGsrrOewkb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tHnFGZtGsrrOewkb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tHnFGZtGsrrOewkb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tHnFGZtGsrrOewkb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tHnFGZtGsrrOewkb.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Set your buttonhole dial to three.\n- Sew up the second side of your buttonhole, stopping at your top mark.\n![Step 7 Image 294031](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6vhJcmrTFxBMYmN2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6vhJcmrTFxBMYmN2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6vhJcmrTFxBMYmN2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6vhJcmrTFxBMYmN2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6vhJcmrTFxBMYmN2.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294034](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hpDAcZAR4DqNH1B1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hpDAcZAR4DqNH1B1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hpDAcZAR4DqNH1B1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hpDAcZAR4DqNH1B1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hpDAcZAR4DqNH1B1.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- Set your buttonhole dial to four.\n- Sew the top bar tack at the top of the buttonhole.\n![Step 8 Image 294037](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/glqREwmVgjXyH6pt.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/glqREwmVgjXyH6pt.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/glqREwmVgjXyH6pt.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/glqREwmVgjXyH6pt.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/glqREwmVgjXyH6pt.full -->\n![Step 8 Image 294040](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Wk1m1HIGjTxknbxk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Wk1m1HIGjTxknbxk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Wk1m1HIGjTxknbxk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Wk1m1HIGjTxknbxk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Wk1m1HIGjTxknbxk.full -->\n\n## 9. Step 9\n- Set your buttonhole dial to five.\n- This setting [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|backstitches]] to hold the thread in place. Sew a few more stitches, which will finish the buttonhole.\n![Step 9 Image 294043](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PlMiLsRtGnrHQMBR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PlMiLsRtGnrHQMBR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PlMiLsRtGnrHQMBR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PlMiLsRtGnrHQMBR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PlMiLsRtGnrHQMBR.full -->\n![Step 9 Image 294045](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xIdkZDmNklsJ2oCU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xIdkZDmNklsJ2oCU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xIdkZDmNklsJ2oCU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xIdkZDmNklsJ2oCU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xIdkZDmNklsJ2oCU.full -->\n\n## 10.

Step 11\n- Use a hobby knife to cut open the buttonhole.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Be careful not to cut through the stitching, you only want to cut the fabric between the rows of stitching.\n![Step 11 Image 294054](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UNe5tvgmY13AYaSA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UNe5tvgmY13AYaSA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UNe5tvgmY13AYaSA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UNe5tvgmY13AYaSA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/UNe5tvgmY13AYaSA.full -->\n![Step 11 Image 294057](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fVZBJHDyU4A5MqVs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fVZBJHDyU4A5MqVs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fVZBJHDyU4A5MqVs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fVZBJHDyU4A5MqVs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fVZBJHDyU4A5MqVs.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Learn to Sew a Straight Seam\n\nThis guide will show you the most basic of seams, the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam|straight seam]]. If this is your first sewing experience, practice on scraps of fabric. Like any skill, sewing requires practice—so take your time! The key is to work carefully and patiently. Sewing machines vary widely and may have different settings. This guide shows the process for a Bernina 830,  but the process will be similar for most machines. Refer to your sewing machine manual for information on specific settings and functions. In this guide we are using contrasting thread for visibility. When it comes time to do your actual project, you'll want to use thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Lay the two pieces of fabric with the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Right_Sides_Together|right sides together]]. Align the edges you would like to sew. Push out all the wrinkles and smooth the fabric flat.\n- Starting at one end of the seam, match the corners and pin them together.\n![Step 1 Image 293996](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qKYfxYWUnKANQYUT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qKYfxYWUnKANQYUT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qKYfxYWUnKANQYUT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qKYfxYWUnKANQYUT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qKYfxYWUnKANQYUT.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 293998](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5gJllTXvhVSV2EOT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5gJllTXvhVSV2EOT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5gJllTXvhVSV2EOT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5gJllTXvhVSV2EOT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5gJllTXvhVSV2EOT.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 294001](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EpCU5RMVGURpWcNO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EpCU5RMVGURpWcNO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EpCU5RMVGURpWcNO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EpCU5RMVGURpWcNO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EpCU5RMVGURpWcNO.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Work your way down the edge to be sewn, pining the two pieces of fabric together.\n> **Note:** The closer the pins are, the more stable the fabric will be. However, you will have to stop to remove each pin as you sew. If you're just getting started, use a pin every inch or two of fabric.\n![Step 2 Image 294005](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZnICoJOd1JQPpSW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZnICoJOd1JQPpSW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZnICoJOd1JQPpSW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZnICoJOd1JQPpSW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZnICoJOd1JQPpSW.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294007](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o5VdfUWrUuiWjCf4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o5VdfUWrUuiWjCf4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o5VdfUWrUuiWjCf4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o5VdfUWrUuiWjCf4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/o5VdfUWrUuiWjCf4.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Make sure the settings on your sewing machine are set to sew a straight stitch.\n- Slide the corner of your fabric into the sewing machine, directly under the hole in the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Pressor_Foot|presser foot]].\n- Align the edge of your fabric with the edge of the pressor foot.\n> **Note:** This will act as a guide while you sew, and will help you keep you seam straight. In this case, it will leave a quarter-inch [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam_Allowance|seam allowance]]. You can use a different guide if you would like.\n- Lower the presser foot using the presser foot lever.\n![Step 3 Image 294012](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/x5tUXCOFyXjVBCIV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/x5tUXCOFyXjVBCIV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/x5tUXCOFyXjVBCIV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/x5tUXCOFyXjVBCIV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/x5tUXCOFyXjVBCIV.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294014](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YYUnsCbANj63IT4U.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YYUnsCbANj63IT4U.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YYUnsCbANj63IT4U.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YYUnsCbANj63IT4U.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YYUnsCbANj63IT4U.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294017](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LJfsoEYlLg2LFsXa.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LJfsoEYlLg2LFsXa.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LJfsoEYlLg2LFsXa.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LJfsoEYlLg2LFsXa.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/LJfsoEYlLg2LFsXa.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Use the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Balance_Wheel|balance wheel]] (also know as the hand wheel) to advance the sewing machine  until the needle has sunk into the fabric.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** The balance wheel should only be turned in the direction that advances the sewing machine. Usually, this means turning the wheel towards you. Turning the wheel in the opposite direction can ruin the tension on the sewing machine, causing it to jam. See your sewing machine manual for instructions specific to your machine.\n![Step 4 Image 294022](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZCIsw5JDI5yFIT6m.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZCIsw5JDI5yFIT6m.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZCIsw5JDI5yFIT6m.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZCIsw5JDI5yFIT6m.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZCIsw5JDI5yFIT6m.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294024](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rLRuNICJXcHpjPoP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rLRuNICJXcHpjPoP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rLRuNICJXcHpjPoP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rLRuNICJXcHpjPoP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rLRuNICJXcHpjPoP.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Engage your [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|backstitch]] function.\n> **Note:** Backstitch functions vary widely between machines and can come in the form of buttons, levers, and knobs. See your sewing machine manual for instructions on your backstitch function.\n- Depress the pedal slowly. This will start the sewing machine sewing backwards.\n- Sew two or three stitches backwards.\n- Release the pedal.\n- Release your backstitch function.\n![Step 5 Image 294028](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eOEb43aqnmRLtTTK.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eOEb43aqnmRLtTTK.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eOEb43aqnmRLtTTK.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eOEb43aqnmRLtTTK.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eOEb43aqnmRLtTTK.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294030](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b6pMxZQO6mdY4RSH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b6pMxZQO6mdY4RSH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b6pMxZQO6mdY4RSH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b6pMxZQO6mdY4RSH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/b6pMxZQO6mdY4RSH.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Depress the pedal and sew slowly forward, guiding the fabric with your hands as you go.\n> **Note:** When guiding the fabric through a sewing machine you should not be pushing or pulling. The machine will feed the fabric in at the right speed. Your job is merely to guide the fabric so the seam remains straight.\n- Keep the fabric aligned to the edge of the presser foot as you sew.\n- Stop before you reach each pin. Pull the pins out, being careful not to misalign the fabric.\n![Step 6 Image 294033](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nB6anAcFgWRAvSC1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nB6anAcFgWRAvSC1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nB6anAcFgWRAvSC1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nB6anAcFgWRAvSC1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nB6anAcFgWRAvSC1.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294036](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MG1xA1wIMShCMNl2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MG1xA1wIMShCMNl2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MG1xA1wIMShCMNl2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MG1xA1wIMShCMNl2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MG1xA1wIMShCMNl2.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294038](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FmcgdZMyMeB1rPb4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FmcgdZMyMeB1rPb4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FmcgdZMyMeB1rPb4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FmcgdZMyMeB1rPb4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FmcgdZMyMeB1rPb4.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- When you come to the end of your seam, engage the backstitch function.\n- Sew two or three stitches backwards.\n- Release the backstitch function and sew forward off the fabric.\n- Turn the balance wheel until the needle is up.\n![Step 7 Image 294041](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OVtTCMwGBD2DhFpP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OVtTCMwGBD2DhFpP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OVtTCMwGBD2DhFpP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OVtTCMwGBD2DhFpP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OVtTCMwGBD2DhFpP.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294044](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nJ1LKJ6CiH4pCIEW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nJ1LKJ6CiH4pCIEW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nJ1LKJ6CiH4pCIEW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nJ1LKJ6CiH4pCIEW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nJ1LKJ6CiH4pCIEW.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294046](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/guw5BcRuZmmjGefA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/guw5BcRuZmmjGefA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/guw5BcRuZmmjGefA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/guw5BcRuZmmjGefA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/guw5BcRuZmmjGefA.full -->\n\n## 8.

        "raw_content": "# Zigzag Stitch\n\nThe [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Zigzag_Stitch|zigzag stitch]] is a basic sewing skill and often used for stability or with stretchy fabrics. For this guide we’re using a Bernina 830 sewing machine, but the procedure should be similar on most machines with a mechanical stitch width dial. Check your sewing machine’s owner’s manual for instructions specific to your machine. In this guide we’re using contrasting thread for visibility. When it comes time to do your actual project, you’ll want to use thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Fit your sewing machine with a [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Presser_Foot|presser foot]] that has a wide hole.\n- Set your sewing machine's stitch width to a three. This sets the machine to a typical zigzag stitch, but you can adjust to your taste. Zero is straight stitch, and the most drastic zigzag stitch maxes out at 4.\n- Each machine is different; check your manual.\n![Step 1 Image 294029](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OKfL22Bt62FbDFao.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OKfL22Bt62FbDFao.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OKfL22Bt62FbDFao.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OKfL22Bt62FbDFao.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OKfL22Bt62FbDFao.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 294032](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kUIbxRLCj1OYWEtG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kUIbxRLCj1OYWEtG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kUIbxRLCj1OYWEtG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kUIbxRLCj1OYWEtG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kUIbxRLCj1OYWEtG.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Insert your fabric into the sewing machine and depress the presser foot.\n- [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|Backstitch]] and begin sewing.\n![Step 2 Image 294035](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2QUWdWw1TdOr2LWr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2QUWdWw1TdOr2LWr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2QUWdWw1TdOr2LWr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2QUWdWw1TdOr2LWr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2QUWdWw1TdOr2LWr.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294039](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sKsxDjeftXhaOlKk.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sKsxDjeftXhaOlKk.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sKsxDjeftXhaOlKk.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sKsxDjeftXhaOlKk.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sKsxDjeftXhaOlKk.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Guide the fabric through the machine to keep the stitch straight.\n> **Note:** When guiding the fabric through a sewing machine you should not be pushing or pulling. The machine will feed the fabric in at the right speed. Your job is merely to guide the fabric so the seam remains straight.\n- Lift the presser foot, cut the threads, and voilà!\n![Step 3 Image 294042](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/shctQPRdrXGlBv4F.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/shctQPRdrXGlBv4F.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/shctQPRdrXGlBv4F.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/shctQPRdrXGlBv4F.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/shctQPRdrXGlBv4F.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Installing Sewing Machine Bobbin\n\nA bobbin is a small spool of thread that  feeds the thread for the backside of the stitch. No sewing machine can sew without one. An incorrectly set up bobbin will create tangles in the thread. [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Bobbin|Bobbin]] setups vary from machine to machine. This guide shows the process for a Bernina 830, but the process will be similar for most sewing machines, except for those with drop-in bobbins. Refer to your sewing machine’s owner’s manual for specific directions on how to install a bobbin in your machine.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1.

        "raw_content": "# Press and Iron Fabrics\n\nThe techniques of pressing and ironing are often used interchangeably. Both use an iron, but each is a different technique. Ironing is the action of sliding the iron over fabric or a [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam|seam]]. Pressing involves resting the iron directly onto the fabric or seam, holding the iron in place, and then pulling it away. In pressing, there’s no sliding motion. Pressing protects delicate or loosely woven fabrics (such as silk or linen) from getting distorted while removing wrinkles. The ironing motion removes wrinkles from stable fabrics and proves particularly useful on large, single-layered fabrics.Once you’ve decided whether to press or iron your fabric, you’ll need to decide whether or not to steam the fabric as you proceed. Try a dry iron first, and only steam when there’s a stubborn wrinkle. Before steaming, be sure you’re using a fabric that won’t be harmed with water.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Press a Seam\n- Set your iron to the appropriate fabric setting.\n> **Note:** If your garment has more than one type of fabric, use the setting for the type of fabric with the lowest heat setting.\n![Step 1 Image 294064](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CsQANllQSSLxqkt2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CsQANllQSSLxqkt2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CsQANllQSSLxqkt2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CsQANllQSSLxqkt2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CsQANllQSSLxqkt2.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Lay your wrinkly fabric or garment onto the ironing table.\n- Make sure there is only one layer of fabric on the ironing board.\n![Step 2 Image 294066](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eDbhqg2UTw5gV4HA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eDbhqg2UTw5gV4HA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eDbhqg2UTw5gV4HA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eDbhqg2UTw5gV4HA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eDbhqg2UTw5gV4HA.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Don't start ironing directly on the seam you want to flatten. Start on the fabric next to the seam. Bring the iron onto the fabric and then slide over the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam|seam]].\n> **Note:** Only iron in one direction. Each stroke should move the same way. After each stroke, lift the iron and start over.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not push down. Allow the heat and weight of the iron to do the work.\n![Step 3 Image 294068](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rhk6QTKVXHwZkySQ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rhk6QTKVXHwZkySQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rhk6QTKVXHwZkySQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rhk6QTKVXHwZkySQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rhk6QTKVXHwZkySQ.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294070](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CeTVke2Ys1TEZriJ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CeTVke2Ys1TEZriJ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CeTVke2Ys1TEZriJ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CeTVke2Ys1TEZriJ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CeTVke2Ys1TEZriJ.full -->\n\n## 4. Ironing a Seam\n- When ironing a seam, flip the project inside out so the seam is visible.\n- Slide the fabric over the end of the ironing board, seam side up, so that only one layer of the fabric is ironed at a time.\n![Step 4 Image 294072](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cVJTZetSFDoANGih.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cVJTZetSFDoANGih.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cVJTZetSFDoANGih.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cVJTZetSFDoANGih.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cVJTZetSFDoANGih.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294074](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ajZML3R24b3Nhyd4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ajZML3R24b3Nhyd4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ajZML3R24b3Nhyd4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ajZML3R24b3Nhyd4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ajZML3R24b3Nhyd4.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Using the same technique as above, work in one direction over the seam, ironing it flat.\n- Work up the seam until the whole seam lays flat.\n> **Note:** Allow the iron to do the work. Do not apply extra pressure. If you have a stubborn wrinkle, apply steam from your iron or mist the fabric with distilled water, then press the wrinkle.\n![Step 5 Image 294076](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VGSMa6PfolUUfDYU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VGSMa6PfolUUfDYU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VGSMa6PfolUUfDYU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VGSMa6PfolUUfDYU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VGSMa6PfolUUfDYU.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294078](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dsPZfbKjXmmmtdNw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dsPZfbKjXmmmtdNw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dsPZfbKjXmmmtdNw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dsPZfbKjXmmmtdNw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dsPZfbKjXmmmtdNw.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294079](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/261WZ6IECQbwImcu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/261WZ6IECQbwImcu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/261WZ6IECQbwImcu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/261WZ6IECQbwImcu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/261WZ6IECQbwImcu.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- To press a seam, open the seam up by separating the two pieces of fabric in the seam.\n- Take the iron and go directly down onto the seam.\n- Do not move the iron, simply let the iron sit on the seam for 10-30 seconds. Lift and repeat.\n> **Note:** Allow the iron to do the work. Don't apply lots of pressure. If you have a stubborn wrinkle, apply steam from your iron, or mist the fabric with distilled water before pressing.\n![Step 6 Image 294080](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fuWU6UC2UulRyIVD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fuWU6UC2UulRyIVD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fuWU6UC2UulRyIVD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fuWU6UC2UulRyIVD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/fuWU6UC2UulRyIVD.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294081](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dBlDdDqPIi32o3mU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dBlDdDqPIi32o3mU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dBlDdDqPIi32o3mU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dBlDdDqPIi32o3mU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dBlDdDqPIi32o3mU.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294082](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OwbnR5OqTPDoZo6K.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OwbnR5OqTPDoZo6K.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OwbnR5OqTPDoZo6K.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OwbnR5OqTPDoZo6K.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OwbnR5OqTPDoZo6K.full -->",

In this guide we’re using contrasting thread for visibility, but when it comes time to do your actual project, you’ll want to use thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Lay the two pieces of fabric with the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Right_Sides_Together|right sides together]].\n- Align the edges you would like to sew. Push out all the wrinkles and smooth the fabric flat.\n![Step 1 Image 294084](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iDNJMLCku2DAVSb5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iDNJMLCku2DAVSb5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iDNJMLCku2DAVSb5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iDNJMLCku2DAVSb5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iDNJMLCku2DAVSb5.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 294085](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/65L452ECl1sJOrJl.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/65L452ECl1sJOrJl.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/65L452ECl1sJOrJl.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/65L452ECl1sJOrJl.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/65L452ECl1sJOrJl.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Starting at one end of the seam, match the corners and [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Pins|pin]] them together.\n- Work your way down the edge to be sewn, pinning the two pieces of fabric together.\n> **Note:** The closer the pins are, the more stable their hold will be. However, you will have to stop to remove each pin as you sew. For a beginner's skill level, space the pins an inch or two apart.\n- Continue until you've pinned the two pieces of fabric from corner to corner.\n![Step 2 Image 294086](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tymfMM5PTeKCj5RI.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tymfMM5PTeKCj5RI.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tymfMM5PTeKCj5RI.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tymfMM5PTeKCj5RI.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tymfMM5PTeKCj5RI.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294087](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11HWJcTh4wSY1PUy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11HWJcTh4wSY1PUy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11HWJcTh4wSY1PUy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11HWJcTh4wSY1PUy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/11HWJcTh4wSY1PUy.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294088](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FabHMwWITctZkKmF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FabHMwWITctZkKmF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FabHMwWITctZkKmF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FabHMwWITctZkKmF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FabHMwWITctZkKmF.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Align the edge of the fabric with the edge of the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Presser_Foot|presser foot]], then depress the presser foot.\n- Engage the sewing machine's [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|backstitch function]].\n> **Note:** Backstitch functions vary widely between machines and can come in the form of buttons, levers, and knobs. See your sewing machine manual for instructions on your backstitch function.\n- Depress the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Pedal|pedal]] slowly. Sew two or three stitches backwards. Release the pedal and disengage the backstitch function.\n![Step 3 Image 294089](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lI5LF36OqKbHGxUR.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lI5LF36OqKbHGxUR.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lI5LF36OqKbHGxUR.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lI5LF36OqKbHGxUR.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lI5LF36OqKbHGxUR.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294090](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/k2g1lPTP126daHSA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/k2g1lPTP126daHSA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/k2g1lPTP126daHSA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/k2g1lPTP126daHSA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/k2g1lPTP126daHSA.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294091](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eKFDn2VdJjKmNFA1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eKFDn2VdJjKmNFA1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eKFDn2VdJjKmNFA1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eKFDn2VdJjKmNFA1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eKFDn2VdJjKmNFA1.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Depress the pedal and sew slowly forward, guiding the fabric with your hands as you go.\n> **Note:** When guiding the fabric through a sewing machine you should not be pushing or pulling. The machine will feed the fabric in at the right speed. Your job is merely to guide the fabric so the seam remains straight.\n- Keep the fabric aligned to the edge of the presser foot as you sew.\n- Stop before you reach each pin. Pull the pins out, being careful not to misalign the fabric.\n![Step 4 Image 294092](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YOOwOFT1qXXSXYuM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YOOwOFT1qXXSXYuM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YOOwOFT1qXXSXYuM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YOOwOFT1qXXSXYuM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/YOOwOFT1qXXSXYuM.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294093](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kQiNVAZrfvAp3yB1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kQiNVAZrfvAp3yB1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kQiNVAZrfvAp3yB1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kQiNVAZrfvAp3yB1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/kQiNVAZrfvAp3yB1.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294094](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nxPFsfwNTUd2OkkW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nxPFsfwNTUd2OkkW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nxPFsfwNTUd2OkkW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nxPFsfwNTUd2OkkW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/nxPFsfwNTUd2OkkW.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Continue to sew along the curved edge.\n- Pull out the last pin and sew up to the fabric's end.\n- When you come to the end of your seam, engage the backstitch function. Sew two or three stitches backwards. Release the backstitch function and sew forward off the fabric.\n- Turn the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Balance_Wheel|balance wheel]] until the needle is up.\n- Lift the presser foot up and clip the threads holding the fabric to the machine as close to the fabric as possible.\n![Step 5 Image 294095](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BKOjUvYDukxePdtT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BKOjUvYDukxePdtT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BKOjUvYDukxePdtT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BKOjUvYDukxePdtT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BKOjUvYDukxePdtT.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294096](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4yFshQZWZJIhWeu6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4yFshQZWZJIhWeu6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4yFshQZWZJIhWeu6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4yFshQZWZJIhWeu6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4yFshQZWZJIhWeu6.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294097](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atFPcZMMrgDGodrl.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atFPcZMMrgDGodrl.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atFPcZMMrgDGodrl.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atFPcZMMrgDGodrl.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/atFPcZMMrgDGodrl.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Lay out the newly sewn fabric on your work surface.\n- With a pair of fabric scissors, make a series of cuts about 1 cm apart into the raw edge of the seam until the fabric begins to curve. This will ensure that the seam lays flat.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Do not cut the seam itself, or you will have to resew the section.\n![Step 6 Image 294098](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HxDuNZWNJCywnVBf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HxDuNZWNJCywnVBf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HxDuNZWNJCywnVBf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HxDuNZWNJCywnVBf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HxDuNZWNJCywnVBf.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294099](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QSIjdtquTuyhlBN2.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QSIjdtquTuyhlBN2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QSIjdtquTuyhlBN2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QSIjdtquTuyhlBN2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QSIjdtquTuyhlBN2.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Once the edge of the fabric begins to curve, begin cutting small triangles about every inch along the edge with the point facing towards the seam.\n> **Note:** The more triangles you cut, the smoother your seam will lay.\n- Continue cutting small triangles along the length of the fabric.\n> **Note:** As with the beginning, you may simply cut slits into the straight sections, while curved edges require triangles.\n![Step 7 Image 294100](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/grGBcqWIahD2YdPO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/grGBcqWIahD2YdPO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/grGBcqWIahD2YdPO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/grGBcqWIahD2YdPO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/grGBcqWIahD2YdPO.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294101](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZPoYdJQcKTsNIqb.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZPoYdJQcKTsNIqb.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZPoYdJQcKTsNIqb.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZPoYdJQcKTsNIqb.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CZPoYdJQcKTsNIqb.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294102](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SdGfCebNYOqGdlmY.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SdGfCebNYOqGdlmY.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SdGfCebNYOqGdlmY.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SdGfCebNYOqGdlmY.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/SdGfCebNYOqGdlmY.full -->\n\n## 8. Step 8\n- Once you have cut triangles all along the seam, turn the fabric inside out so that the seam is now on the inside.\n- As you turn the fabric inside out, adjust the fabric at the raw edge of the seam to get the smoothest seam possible.\n- Once your fabric is inside-out and your seam is flat, stand back and admire your beautiful handiwork.\n![Step 8 Image 294103](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BqcyEMkNvQZSD3yP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BqcyEMkNvQZSD3yP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BqcyEMkNvQZSD3yP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BqcyEMkNvQZSD3yP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BqcyEMkNvQZSD3yP.full -->\n![Step 8 Image 294104](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dpOqBPDDXZevXpFC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dpOqBPDDXZevXpFC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dpOqBPDDXZevXpFC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dpOqBPDDXZevXpFC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dpOqBPDDXZevXpFC.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",

        "raw_content": "# Thread a Sewing Machine\n\nYou don’t need a sewing machine to sew. But a machine can save you a lot of time when you make repairs, so if you have access to a sewing machine, here’s how to thread it. In this guide we’re using a Bernina 830, but the process will be similar for most sewing machines. Refer to your sewing machine’s owner’s manual for specific directions on how to thread the machine.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Place a spool on the pin. Pull the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Thread|thread]] from the spool straight out, following the length of the machine.\n- Hook the thread under the eyelet on the outer edge of the machine.\n- With one hand, hold the spool steady. Using the eyelet as a pivot, pull the string perpendicular with the other hand. Lay the thread into the slot, which bisects the top of the machine.\n![Step 1 Image 294106](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BwXMSMKWw5EsOGcG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BwXMSMKWw5EsOGcG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BwXMSMKWw5EsOGcG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BwXMSMKWw5EsOGcG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BwXMSMKWw5EsOGcG.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 294107](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WRNoLITd1YRCyqXw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WRNoLITd1YRCyqXw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WRNoLITd1YRCyqXw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WRNoLITd1YRCyqXw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WRNoLITd1YRCyqXw.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 294108](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IaobXnFyoVrDcsAc.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IaobXnFyoVrDcsAc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IaobXnFyoVrDcsAc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IaobXnFyoVrDcsAc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IaobXnFyoVrDcsAc.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Pull the thread all the way across the slot on the top of the sewing machine. Then, pull the thread down toward the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Presser_Foot|presser foot]].\n- There is a lever just above the presser foot. Hook the thread under the lever until it rests in the crux.\n- Pull the thread back up toward the top of the machine.\n![Step 2 Image 294109](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xbMap3PPnnXFsGWL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xbMap3PPnnXFsGWL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xbMap3PPnnXFsGWL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xbMap3PPnnXFsGWL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xbMap3PPnnXFsGWL.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294110](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IxPifhOHuIP5yjVP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IxPifhOHuIP5yjVP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IxPifhOHuIP5yjVP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IxPifhOHuIP5yjVP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IxPifhOHuIP5yjVP.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294111](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xVyZY1wdbXvhhyoG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xVyZY1wdbXvhhyoG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xVyZY1wdbXvhhyoG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xVyZY1wdbXvhhyoG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xVyZY1wdbXvhhyoG.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- At the top of the machine, lead the thread along the groove of the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Take_up_Lever|take-up lever]].\n- Once you've fed the thread into the crux of the take-up lever, pull the thread back down towards the presser foot.\n> **Note:** If you've threaded correctly, your thread should form a complete zigzag—first down, then up, then back down all the way to the presser foot.\n![Step 3 Image 294112](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HDSJXwpmhScAQWn5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HDSJXwpmhScAQWn5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HDSJXwpmhScAQWn5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HDSJXwpmhScAQWn5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HDSJXwpmhScAQWn5.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294113](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NOpO4trBDsxDtxSL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NOpO4trBDsxDtxSL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NOpO4trBDsxDtxSL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NOpO4trBDsxDtxSL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NOpO4trBDsxDtxSL.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294114](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bSXfFhaOVC2SXkyw.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bSXfFhaOVC2SXkyw.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bSXfFhaOVC2SXkyw.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bSXfFhaOVC2SXkyw.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bSXfFhaOVC2SXkyw.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Hook the thread behind the small, bent arm where the needle attaches to the machine.\n- Guide the thread, from front to back, through the eye of the needle, leaving a loose end of approximately 10 cm.\n> **Note:** If the end of your thread has frayed and you cannot guide it through the eye of the needle, snip off the frayed end and try again.\n![Step 4 Image 294115](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gPkTPcn6mwS3meKF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gPkTPcn6mwS3meKF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gPkTPcn6mwS3meKF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gPkTPcn6mwS3meKF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gPkTPcn6mwS3meKF.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294116](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/djZAHm5LHbIk1uyq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/djZAHm5LHbIk1uyq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/djZAHm5LHbIk1uyq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/djZAHm5LHbIk1uyq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/djZAHm5LHbIk1uyq.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- After you've guided the thread through the eye of the needle, pull the thread down and through the large groove in the presser foot.\n- Hook the thread along the groove and pull it perpendicular toward the body of the machine.\n![Step 5 Image 294117](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RE6JFn14seEayv51.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RE6JFn14seEayv51.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RE6JFn14seEayv51.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RE6JFn14seEayv51.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RE6JFn14seEayv51.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294118](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XI2XJU4XVqeWRTIF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XI2XJU4XVqeWRTIF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XI2XJU4XVqeWRTIF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XI2XJU4XVqeWRTIF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XI2XJU4XVqeWRTIF.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- While continuing to hold the top thread advance the sewing machine with the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Balance_Wheel|balance wheel]] (also know as the hand wheel), to pick up the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Bobbin|bobbin]] thread.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Only turn the balance wheel in the direction that advances the machine. Usually, this means turning the wheel towards you. Turning the wheel in the opposite direction can ruin the tension on the sewing machine, causing it to jam. See your sewing machine manual for instructions specific to your machine.\n- Grasp these two threads between pinched fingers and pull them in unison toward the body of the machine, leaving two to three inch tails.\n![Step 6 Image 294119](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/62ANuijKkqUwRBS5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/62ANuijKkqUwRBS5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/62ANuijKkqUwRBS5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/62ANuijKkqUwRBS5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/62ANuijKkqUwRBS5.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294120](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBfbOnNNQgxIPQYq.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBfbOnNNQgxIPQYq.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBfbOnNNQgxIPQYq.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBfbOnNNQgxIPQYq.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NBfbOnNNQgxIPQYq.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294121](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IVP5jCYxnldVJVHs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IVP5jCYxnldVJVHs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IVP5jCYxnldVJVHs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IVP5jCYxnldVJVHs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IVP5jCYxnldVJVHs.full -->\n\n## 7.

        "raw_content": "# Sew a Button\n\nReplacing a button is one of the most common clothing repairs. Fortunately, it's also one of the easiest. This guide will show you how to reattach a standard four-hole button with a needle and thread. In this guide we're using contrasting thread for visibility, but when it comes time to do your actual project, you'll want to use thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Locate the area where the button has gone missing.\n![Step 1 Image 294634](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AJVRFKIRQqGFxDLB.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AJVRFKIRQqGFxDLB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AJVRFKIRQqGFxDLB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AJVRFKIRQqGFxDLB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AJVRFKIRQqGFxDLB.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Overlap the buttonhole with where the button should be. Going through the buttonhole, mark the fabric below with tailor's chalk.\n![Step 2 Image 294635](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xHDiqMCGNLIONvIX.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xHDiqMCGNLIONvIX.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xHDiqMCGNLIONvIX.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xHDiqMCGNLIONvIX.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xHDiqMCGNLIONvIX.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 294636](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IYlNPtYPidjEDlJ3.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IYlNPtYPidjEDlJ3.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IYlNPtYPidjEDlJ3.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IYlNPtYPidjEDlJ3.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/IYlNPtYPidjEDlJ3.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Get a [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Thread|length of thread]]—about an arms-length should be more than enough.\n- Thread a needle.\n![Step 3 Image 294637](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sMJXoxLtE2WWTXHF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sMJXoxLtE2WWTXHF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sMJXoxLtE2WWTXHF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sMJXoxLtE2WWTXHF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/sMJXoxLtE2WWTXHF.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 294638](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VgRTo1cdUHtr3ffS.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VgRTo1cdUHtr3ffS.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VgRTo1cdUHtr3ffS.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VgRTo1cdUHtr3ffS.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VgRTo1cdUHtr3ffS.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Let the needle slide down the thread until it hangs at the center. You should have two equal lengths of thread on either side of the needle.\n- Tie the loose ends of the thread together.\n![Step 4 Image 294639](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qVjctxHX1X5VACqD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qVjctxHX1X5VACqD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qVjctxHX1X5VACqD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qVjctxHX1X5VACqD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qVjctxHX1X5VACqD.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294641](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OjIipWpXQihXkVmo.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OjIipWpXQihXkVmo.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OjIipWpXQihXkVmo.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OjIipWpXQihXkVmo.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OjIipWpXQihXkVmo.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 294642](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ukuAc5hLEEgNX2Ve.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ukuAc5hLEEgNX2Ve.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ukuAc5hLEEgNX2Ve.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ukuAc5hLEEgNX2Ve.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ukuAc5hLEEgNX2Ve.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Tie a second regular knot over the first one to make it bigger. You don't want the thread slipping right through the grain of the fabric.\n![Step 5 Image 294643](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sig4y5YiAhTnmMjn.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sig4y5YiAhTnmMjn.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sig4y5YiAhTnmMjn.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sig4y5YiAhTnmMjn.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Sig4y5YiAhTnmMjn.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 294644](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AMQ2EnQEOOUPoiMp.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AMQ2EnQEOOUPoiMp.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AMQ2EnQEOOUPoiMp.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AMQ2EnQEOOUPoiMp.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/AMQ2EnQEOOUPoiMp.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Poke the needle up through the chalk mark  from the underside of the fabric.\n- Pull the thread taut, until the knot catches the backside of the fabric.\n![Step 6 Image 294645](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CMBjOgJDUCuD62hx.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CMBjOgJDUCuD62hx.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CMBjOgJDUCuD62hx.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CMBjOgJDUCuD62hx.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CMBjOgJDUCuD62hx.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294646](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZbmU6QTPuVUkctr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZbmU6QTPuVUkctr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZbmU6QTPuVUkctr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZbmU6QTPuVUkctr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WZbmU6QTPuVUkctr.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 294647](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2DnAGNexKoCYPQ2C.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2DnAGNexKoCYPQ2C.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2DnAGNexKoCYPQ2C.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2DnAGNexKoCYPQ2C.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2DnAGNexKoCYPQ2C.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Thread the needle through one hole of the button. You can pick any hole to start with.\n- Let the button drop all the way down onto the fabric.\n![Step 7 Image 294648](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/h3LUxFoPeNvk6GlM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/h3LUxFoPeNvk6GlM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/h3LUxFoPeNvk6GlM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/h3LUxFoPeNvk6GlM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/h3LUxFoPeNvk6GlM.full -->\n![Step 7 Image 294649](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/q1gCegrZSSGZRRwi.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/q1gCegrZSSGZRRwi.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/q1gCegrZSSGZRRwi.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/q1gCegrZSSGZRRwi.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/q1gCegrZSSGZRRwi.full -->\n\n## 8.

        "raw_content": "# How to Clean Up Solder Pads\n\nIn this guide, I am going to show you how to clean up solder pads on a logic board. I'll be working on a Chinese A13 Allwinner tablet. I'm cleaning the solder pads for the battery, so I can solder a new battery onto the logic board.\n\n## 1. Equipment and supplies\n> **Note:** The materials needed for this are a soldering iron, soldering paste and desoldering wire, also known as a wick.\n> **Note:** The soldering paste helps the solder flow into the wick better. If you don't have soldering paste, you can get similar results with flux.\n![Step 1 Image 307579](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HIaJuQDLS3TqmoQM.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HIaJuQDLS3TqmoQM.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HIaJuQDLS3TqmoQM.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HIaJuQDLS3TqmoQM.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HIaJuQDLS3TqmoQM.full -->\n\n## 2. Prep the area\n> **Note:** There are many types of soldering paste—many of which are in a syringe-like tube, which makes it easy to get the paste in the exact spot it needs to be.\n> **Note:** I personally use a plastic opening tool to scoop a little out and apply it gently on the spot I will be working on.\n> **Note:** If you don't have soldering paste, apply some flux to the spot you're working on.\n![Step 2 Image 307582](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/L5rWh1HORALWhNjf.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/L5rWh1HORALWhNjf.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/L5rWh1HORALWhNjf.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/L5rWh1HORALWhNjf.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/L5rWh1HORALWhNjf.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- The location I will be de-soldering is right above the SPK location in the photo.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** ***If you're de-soldering battery connections, be very careful not to short the contacts with your soldering iron or the solder wick. *** If possible, cut the battery wires first, one at a time. This removes the chance of accidentally shorting the battery.\n![Step 3 Image 308721](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VpCLxeSPQiwFbKVn.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VpCLxeSPQiwFbKVn.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VpCLxeSPQiwFbKVn.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VpCLxeSPQiwFbKVn.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/VpCLxeSPQiwFbKVn.full -->\n\n## 4. Heat the solder joint\n- Place the de-soldering wick on the solder joint and put the tip of the soldering iron on it so the wick can heat up and absorb the old solder.\n- ***Lift the wick and the [product|IF145-495|soldering iron|new_window=true] up from the logic board at the same time.*** Failure to do so can cause the leftover solder to harden and solder the wick to the logic board and you could easily pull a logic board pad off.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Please remember that logic board components are very fragile and excessive heat can destroy these components.\n![Step 4 Image 307583](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u6yupmSJnFqShxPy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u6yupmSJnFqShxPy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u6yupmSJnFqShxPy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u6yupmSJnFqShxPy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u6yupmSJnFqShxPy.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 307587](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rg4MBVth5VuchmUr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rg4MBVth5VuchmUr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rg4MBVth5VuchmUr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rg4MBVth5VuchmUr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Rg4MBVth5VuchmUr.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- What’s left over is clean points on the solder board, ready for fresh solder.\n![Step 5 Image 308720](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsxeL1kyHmGP1ZTO.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsxeL1kyHmGP1ZTO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsxeL1kyHmGP1ZTO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsxeL1kyHmGP1ZTO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tsxeL1kyHmGP1ZTO.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor more soldering guides and tips, check out [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Soldering|this page|new_window=true].",

Not to worry—a needle threader makes the task simple.\n\n\n\n[link|https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/patagonia|Return to the Patagonia Care & Repair homepage|new_window=true].\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Take the needle threader in one hand, and the needle in your other hand.\n- Insert the wire loop on the needle threader through the eye of the needle.\n![Step 1 Image 309845](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1idE2DgEm1tB4BTT.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1idE2DgEm1tB4BTT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1idE2DgEm1tB4BTT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1idE2DgEm1tB4BTT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1idE2DgEm1tB4BTT.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 309843](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4eLFCtc1cJlU2TEa.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4eLFCtc1cJlU2TEa.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4eLFCtc1cJlU2TEa.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4eLFCtc1cJlU2TEa.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4eLFCtc1cJlU2TEa.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Hold both the needle threader and needle in one hand, while keeping the loop of wire on the needle threader through the eye of the needle.\n- Insert your thread through the loop of wire on the needle threader.\n- Pull the thread through the loop so that you have a tail of least a few inches in length.\n![Step 2 Image 309842](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HUrUopOyXAPeLa6P.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HUrUopOyXAPeLa6P.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HUrUopOyXAPeLa6P.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HUrUopOyXAPeLa6P.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HUrUopOyXAPeLa6P.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309847](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/46Y65n4XS3TmMAaC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/46Y65n4XS3TmMAaC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/46Y65n4XS3TmMAaC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/46Y65n4XS3TmMAaC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/46Y65n4XS3TmMAaC.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309840](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PhPLkgNDQQtMUoRF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PhPLkgNDQQtMUoRF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PhPLkgNDQQtMUoRF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PhPLkgNDQQtMUoRF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PhPLkgNDQQtMUoRF.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Fold the tail over to meet the other thread.\n- Hold both lengths of thread together.\n![Step 3 Image 309839](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NkCee2YdYQs2yTxK.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NkCee2YdYQs2yTxK.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NkCee2YdYQs2yTxK.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NkCee2YdYQs2yTxK.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NkCee2YdYQs2yTxK.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 309838](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ueEYBU6WBOJDPeZD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ueEYBU6WBOJDPeZD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ueEYBU6WBOJDPeZD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ueEYBU6WBOJDPeZD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ueEYBU6WBOJDPeZD.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- While holding both threads, pull the wire loop of the needle threader out of the eye of the needle.\n- Once the wire loop is out of the eye, release the tail end of the thread.\n- Pull the needle threader off the thread. This will bring the tail end through.\n![Step 4 Image 309837](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/K5nKhHFoLyD2pD6X.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/K5nKhHFoLyD2pD6X.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/K5nKhHFoLyD2pD6X.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/K5nKhHFoLyD2pD6X.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/K5nKhHFoLyD2pD6X.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 309850](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ghoBUMMWjwrNwckE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ghoBUMMWjwrNwckE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ghoBUMMWjwrNwckE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ghoBUMMWjwrNwckE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ghoBUMMWjwrNwckE.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 309835](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ED2b6PIIZjuSGyVC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ED2b6PIIZjuSGyVC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ED2b6PIIZjuSGyVC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ED2b6PIIZjuSGyVC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ED2b6PIIZjuSGyVC.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Pull the tail end of the thread until both threads are equal in length.\n- Holding both lengths of thread together, tie a knot near the end and pull it tight.\n> **Note:** This will trap the needle in the loop of thread and allow you to sew with doubled thread. If you prefer to sew with a single thread, tie a knot in only one of the threads, not both.\n![Step 5 Image 309852](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2oOXsU6anLUeYi6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2oOXsU6anLUeYi6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2oOXsU6anLUeYi6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2oOXsU6anLUeYi6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/G2oOXsU6anLUeYi6.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309833](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rsGHobRoKICGnowN.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rsGHobRoKICGnowN.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rsGHobRoKICGnowN.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rsGHobRoKICGnowN.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rsGHobRoKICGnowN.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309834](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/v3YHlAkkth2FAVGF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/v3YHlAkkth2FAVGF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/v3YHlAkkth2FAVGF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/v3YHlAkkth2FAVGF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/v3YHlAkkth2FAVGF.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# How to Sew a Whip Stitch\n\nA whip stitch is an easy way to sew two pieces of fabric together. You can use this stitch whether the edges of the two pieces of material line up or not. If they do line up, the stitch will loop around the outside edge of the material.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- Align the two pieces of material you will be stitching together.\n- [guide|21024|Thread your needle] and tie a knot in the end of the thread.\n> **Note:** We'll use a bright-colored thread for better contrast, but you may want to select a thread that matches the color of your fabric.\n- Drive the needle into the bottom layer of material from the back side.\n![Step 1 Image 309873](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2KgBkuPgGpBtaeIs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2KgBkuPgGpBtaeIs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2KgBkuPgGpBtaeIs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2KgBkuPgGpBtaeIs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2KgBkuPgGpBtaeIs.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 309874](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4IrnOJN4slvwb3px.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4IrnOJN4slvwb3px.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4IrnOJN4slvwb3px.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4IrnOJN4slvwb3px.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4IrnOJN4slvwb3px.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Pull the needle through the bottom layer of material.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 2 Image 309875](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TQSJF5UKyFHTDA3G.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TQSJF5UKyFHTDA3G.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TQSJF5UKyFHTDA3G.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TQSJF5UKyFHTDA3G.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/TQSJF5UKyFHTDA3G.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309877](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KEWsZGF4SerJvOGm.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KEWsZGF4SerJvOGm.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KEWsZGF4SerJvOGm.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KEWsZGF4SerJvOGm.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KEWsZGF4SerJvOGm.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309867](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DvqikjXT2fChCrA5.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DvqikjXT2fChCrA5.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DvqikjXT2fChCrA5.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DvqikjXT2fChCrA5.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/DvqikjXT2fChCrA5.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Drive the needle down through the top and bottom layers of fabric, close to where the needle came up.\n> **Note:** The distance between where the needle comes up and goes down will be your stitch length. The smaller the stitch length, the more stitches required—and the stronger the seam.\n- Pull the thread taut on the backside of the bottom material.\n![Step 3 Image 309866](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CiqRhf25JvOM6Z2A.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CiqRhf25JvOM6Z2A.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CiqRhf25JvOM6Z2A.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CiqRhf25JvOM6Z2A.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/CiqRhf25JvOM6Z2A.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 309878](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eTfDRJ6ZMAvEYKf6.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eTfDRJ6ZMAvEYKf6.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eTfDRJ6ZMAvEYKf6.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eTfDRJ6ZMAvEYKf6.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/eTfDRJ6ZMAvEYKf6.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 309863](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xkdxVeXioN4Gicia.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xkdxVeXioN4Gicia.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xkdxVeXioN4Gicia.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xkdxVeXioN4Gicia.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/xkdxVeXioN4Gicia.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Continue bringing the needle up and down through both layers of fabric, as in steps 2 and 3 of this guide, working your way around the material.\n> **Note:** If you are using this stitch as a repair where a stitch already exists, be sure to overlap the existing stitching by several stitches to help prevent it from unraveling.\n![Step 4 Image 309879](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QEJfbgdCxnIS2BoL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QEJfbgdCxnIS2BoL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QEJfbgdCxnIS2BoL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QEJfbgdCxnIS2BoL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/QEJfbgdCxnIS2BoL.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 309860](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4VSt3vSSyxwRS5SG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4VSt3vSSyxwRS5SG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4VSt3vSSyxwRS5SG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4VSt3vSSyxwRS5SG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4VSt3vSSyxwRS5SG.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- For the final stitch, come up from the back of the bottom material once again.\n- Draw the needle between the two layers of material through the stitch closest to where the needle came up.\n![Step 5 Image 309883](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bsgwlogOHYL3aauU.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bsgwlogOHYL3aauU.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bsgwlogOHYL3aauU.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bsgwlogOHYL3aauU.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bsgwlogOHYL3aauU.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309882](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iJvtA5hGuFWi6jHd.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iJvtA5hGuFWi6jHd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iJvtA5hGuFWi6jHd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iJvtA5hGuFWi6jHd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iJvtA5hGuFWi6jHd.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Slowly start to pull the thread taut. As you pull, you will see a loop form.\n- Draw the needle through the loop.\n- Pull the thread taut, forming a knot.\n- Repeat the process of driving the needle up from behind, drawing it through the stitch, and pulling it through the loop as described in steps 5 and 6 of this guide one more time.\n![Step 6 Image 309858](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qgVLXtf3MFyPkiWu.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qgVLXtf3MFyPkiWu.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qgVLXtf3MFyPkiWu.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qgVLXtf3MFyPkiWu.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/qgVLXtf3MFyPkiWu.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 309857](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dN52koE2vRNWJty4.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dN52koE2vRNWJty4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dN52koE2vRNWJty4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dN52koE2vRNWJty4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dN52koE2vRNWJty4.full -->\n![Step 6 Image 309855](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ptQg5OwJgkZG51BH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ptQg5OwJgkZG51BH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ptQg5OwJgkZG51BH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ptQg5OwJgkZG51BH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ptQg5OwJgkZG51BH.full -->\n\n## 7. Step 7\n- Ensure that the stitches are tight.\n- Cut any remaining thread, and admire your handiwork.\n![Step 7 Image 309885](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDW4RpOwtSOg3ROK.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDW4RpOwtSOg3ROK.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDW4RpOwtSOg3ROK.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDW4RpOwtSOg3ROK.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pDW4RpOwtSOg3ROK.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Sew a Ladder Stitch\n\nA ladder stitch, or closure stitch, is a sewing technique that allows you to close a tear without leaving the stitching visible.\n\nThe trick is to make the stitches as small and as even as possible. This technique works for repairing almost any type of tear.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- [guide|21024|Thread your needle] and tie a knot in the end.\n> **Note:** We're using contrasting thread for visibility, but when it comes time for your repair, you'll want to use matching thread.\n- Drive the needle from the back of the material, just before where the tear starts.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 1 Image 309913](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MAo1aQrFmscsGNaX.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MAo1aQrFmscsGNaX.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MAo1aQrFmscsGNaX.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MAo1aQrFmscsGNaX.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MAo1aQrFmscsGNaX.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 309901](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iZ4TBjt2KOBnxoCm.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iZ4TBjt2KOBnxoCm.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iZ4TBjt2KOBnxoCm.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iZ4TBjt2KOBnxoCm.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/iZ4TBjt2KOBnxoCm.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 309899](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3kbRlLUSPnKiGMiC.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3kbRlLUSPnKiGMiC.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3kbRlLUSPnKiGMiC.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3kbRlLUSPnKiGMiC.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3kbRlLUSPnKiGMiC.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Take a small stitch, going in and out of the material, on one side of the tear only.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 2 Image 309904](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PWH1uPaxmfidoTuE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PWH1uPaxmfidoTuE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PWH1uPaxmfidoTuE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PWH1uPaxmfidoTuE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/PWH1uPaxmfidoTuE.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309907](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5cUAjLBjNNylG3n.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5cUAjLBjNNylG3n.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5cUAjLBjNNylG3n.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5cUAjLBjNNylG3n.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/u5cUAjLBjNNylG3n.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Take a small stitch, going in and out of the material, on the other side of the tear, directly opposite of the stitch you just took.\n- Pull the thread taut. This should cinch the material together.\n> **Note:** If your material bunches, try taking smaller stitches, while ensuring that you line up the stitches on either side of the material.\n![Step 3 Image 309894](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5QOSonyG2QW3prCF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5QOSonyG2QW3prCF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5QOSonyG2QW3prCF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5QOSonyG2QW3prCF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5QOSonyG2QW3prCF.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 309908](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WFTQp2bZP6PcMwnD.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WFTQp2bZP6PcMwnD.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WFTQp2bZP6PcMwnD.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WFTQp2bZP6PcMwnD.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WFTQp2bZP6PcMwnD.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Continue stitching, switching from side to side as described in step 2 and 3 of this guide, pulling the thread taut after each stitch.\n- Stitch until you come to the end of the tear.\n![Step 4 Image 309909](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/66Jw3NYPIOVGG6ab.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/66Jw3NYPIOVGG6ab.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/66Jw3NYPIOVGG6ab.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/66Jw3NYPIOVGG6ab.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/66Jw3NYPIOVGG6ab.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 309897](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H5avRYCUFZDbRMMW.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H5avRYCUFZDbRMMW.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H5avRYCUFZDbRMMW.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H5avRYCUFZDbRMMW.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/H5avRYCUFZDbRMMW.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- One the last stitch, drive the needle through both sides of the fabric, taking as small of a stitch as possible.\n- Slowly pull the thread. As you pull, a loop will form. Draw the needle through this loop, and pull the thread taut.\n- Repeat this step, taking a tiny stitch, drawing the needle through the loop, and pulling taut.\n- Ensure that the stitches are tight, and cut any excess threads.\n![Step 5 Image 309910](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/asNtQUgCCrQWJ1Jy.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/asNtQUgCCrQWJ1Jy.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/asNtQUgCCrQWJ1Jy.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/asNtQUgCCrQWJ1Jy.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/asNtQUgCCrQWJ1Jy.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309911](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XObTJnGU4EwOWrLB.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XObTJnGU4EwOWrLB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XObTJnGU4EwOWrLB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XObTJnGU4EwOWrLB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XObTJnGU4EwOWrLB.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309888](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gorlb5qQItSQSMgs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gorlb5qQItSQSMgs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gorlb5qQItSQSMgs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gorlb5qQItSQSMgs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/gorlb5qQItSQSMgs.full -->",

        "raw_content": "# Sew a Straight Stitch\n\nA straight stitch is the bread and butter of sewing. This basic stitch will sew two pieces of material together, and can be used in many repairs.\n\nThe trick is to take small, even stitches. With a little practice, you can master this basic stitch and repair your textiles.\n\n## 1. Step 1\n- [guide|21024|Thread your needle] and tie a knot in the end of the thread.\n> **Note:** We're using contrasting thread for visibility, but when you do your repair you will want to use matching thread.\n- Drive the needle through the back of the bottom material.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 1 Image 309935](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4i3t1kJJQXX2bf5L.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4i3t1kJJQXX2bf5L.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4i3t1kJJQXX2bf5L.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4i3t1kJJQXX2bf5L.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/4i3t1kJJQXX2bf5L.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 309934](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HYLChXZvSMgRhGiG.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HYLChXZvSMgRhGiG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HYLChXZvSMgRhGiG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HYLChXZvSMgRhGiG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/HYLChXZvSMgRhGiG.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- Drive the needle through the back side of the top material.\n> **Note:** In this case we're sewing a buckle, but you can use this stitch to sew just about anything together.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n- Align the two materials in their final position.\n![Step 2 Image 309933](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FIltD6DAilHNqDKr.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FIltD6DAilHNqDKr.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FIltD6DAilHNqDKr.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FIltD6DAilHNqDKr.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/FIltD6DAilHNqDKr.full -->\n![Step 2 Image 309936](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EjyjjAyuEuvWUHff.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EjyjjAyuEuvWUHff.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EjyjjAyuEuvWUHff.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EjyjjAyuEuvWUHff.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/EjyjjAyuEuvWUHff.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Drive the needle down through both layers of material, coming out on the back side of the bottom material. Push the needle out of the material.\n> **Note:** The closer you drive the needle in to where the thread came up, the smaller the stitch length. Having a smaller stitch length requires more stitches, but creates a stronger seam.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 3 Image 309931](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5x2Klrl2BG1SDELA.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5x2Klrl2BG1SDELA.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5x2Klrl2BG1SDELA.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5x2Klrl2BG1SDELA.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5x2Klrl2BG1SDELA.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 309929](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tZQEbnFoXShQdmEE.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tZQEbnFoXShQdmEE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tZQEbnFoXShQdmEE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tZQEbnFoXShQdmEE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tZQEbnFoXShQdmEE.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- Ensure the two layers are correctly aligned.\n- Drive the needle through both layers of fabric from the back side of the bottom material, coming up on the top side of the top material.\n- Pull the thread taut.\n![Step 4 Image 309927](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1WjMrYPKuJDQAMtP.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1WjMrYPKuJDQAMtP.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1WjMrYPKuJDQAMtP.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1WjMrYPKuJDQAMtP.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1WjMrYPKuJDQAMtP.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 309938](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AJrsHLFZ1HRIiMe.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AJrsHLFZ1HRIiMe.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AJrsHLFZ1HRIiMe.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AJrsHLFZ1HRIiMe.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5AJrsHLFZ1HRIiMe.full -->\n\n## 5. Step 5\n- Continue sewing through both layers, going down from the top and up from the bottom, as described in steps 3 and 4 of this guide.\n- When you come to the end of your material, draw the needle in between the two layers of material, under the thread of the closest stitch.\n- Slowly start to pull the thread taut. As you pull a loop will form.\n- Draw the needle through the loop and pull the thread taut.\n- Repeat the process of drawing the needle between the layers, creating a loop, and drawing the needle through the loop as described in this step.\n![Step 5 Image 309928](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MyAkguGDEZjIbXNs.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MyAkguGDEZjIbXNs.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MyAkguGDEZjIbXNs.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MyAkguGDEZjIbXNs.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MyAkguGDEZjIbXNs.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309939](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3GWPrKX3Pj2YOLgH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3GWPrKX3Pj2YOLgH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3GWPrKX3Pj2YOLgH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3GWPrKX3Pj2YOLgH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/3GWPrKX3Pj2YOLgH.full -->\n![Step 5 Image 309923](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5FhFTRW25CFXCqXL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5FhFTRW25CFXCqXL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5FhFTRW25CFXCqXL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5FhFTRW25CFXCqXL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5FhFTRW25CFXCqXL.full -->\n\n## 6. Step 6\n- Pull the thread taut.\n- Cut any remaining thread and admire your work.\n![Step 6 Image 309941](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XVMpBj2Y2t36MsS1.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XVMpBj2Y2t36MsS1.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XVMpBj2Y2t36MsS1.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XVMpBj2Y2t36MsS1.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/XVMpBj2Y2t36MsS1.full -->",

Step 1\n- Mouse-over '''Options''' on the top right corner of the Question field to reveal a dropdown menu.\n- Click on '''Edit''' to open the Edit Post page.\n- Before adding your image, position the cursor at the place in your text where you want to add the image. We suggest placing it at the end of the question.\n- Click on the image icon to open the Media Manager.\n- Click on '''Add Media''' and select files from your computer to upload.\n> **Note:** Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop images into the Media Manager to upload them. '''If you did this, proceed directly to step 3.'''\n![Step 1 Image 842566](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vRiFCKxvJGCJGDIH.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vRiFCKxvJGCJGDIH.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vRiFCKxvJGCJGDIH.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vRiFCKxvJGCJGDIH.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vRiFCKxvJGCJGDIH.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 842567](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tLnryYUhuMQTGTov.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tLnryYUhuMQTGTov.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tLnryYUhuMQTGTov.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tLnryYUhuMQTGTov.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/tLnryYUhuMQTGTov.full -->\n![Step 1 Image 842568](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RBrFCavfCIkfl5NV.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RBrFCavfCIkfl5NV.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RBrFCavfCIkfl5NV.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RBrFCavfCIkfl5NV.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/RBrFCavfCIkfl5NV.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n- In the Add Media window, you can add images from the internet or your local machine.\n- To add images from your computer:\n  - Click on the '''browse for files''' to find photos on your computer, or simply drag and drop them onto the window.\n- To add images from the internet:\n  - Get the link to your desired image. You can usually do this by right-clicking the image and selecting '''Copy link address'''.\n  - Paste the link into the field provided.\n  - Click '''Grab Media''' to add the image to your Media Manager.\n![Step 2 Image 842576](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOsDKuYecJnNhbZL.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOsDKuYecJnNhbZL.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOsDKuYecJnNhbZL.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOsDKuYecJnNhbZL.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/mOsDKuYecJnNhbZL.full -->\n\n## 3. Step 3\n- Once the image is in your Media Manager, click on it to insert into your question.\n- The image should appear in-line at the spot where your cursor was positioned when you opened the Media Manager.\n> **Note:** iFixit images show up in 4:3 format. Most modern cameras capture in 3:2 or 16:9, which will require a crop. If you change your capturing preferences when taking pictures to 4:3,  you won't need to crop them in the Media Manager.\n![Step 3 Image 842582](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lV11S4Ek3MoStkXn.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lV11S4Ek3MoStkXn.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lV11S4Ek3MoStkXn.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lV11S4Ek3MoStkXn.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lV11S4Ek3MoStkXn.full -->\n![Step 3 Image 842584](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWFrCvSNS6u1SZmo.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWFrCvSNS6u1SZmo.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWFrCvSNS6u1SZmo.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWFrCvSNS6u1SZmo.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/ZWFrCvSNS6u1SZmo.full -->\n\n## 4. Step 4\n- After inserting the image, scroll to the bottom of the page and click '''Preview Edit'''.\n  - A preview will be automatically inserted below the fields for you to review.\n- If everything looks good, click '''Submit Edit'''. If not, scroll back up and adjust your question as necessary.\n![Step 4 Image 842590](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dMgAEA1mwGyNpRKF.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dMgAEA1mwGyNpRKF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dMgAEA1mwGyNpRKF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dMgAEA1mwGyNpRKF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/dMgAEA1mwGyNpRKF.full -->\n![Step 4 Image 842591](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rbQIfZBvoeGcbdZZ.full)\n<!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rbQIfZBvoeGcbdZZ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rbQIfZBvoeGcbdZZ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rbQIfZBvoeGcbdZZ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rbQIfZBvoeGcbdZZ.full -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe image size for insertion must be 800 x 600 pixels otherwise there will be an error message in the Media Manager. It looks complicated, but is actually straightforward.",
