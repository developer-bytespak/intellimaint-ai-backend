## 1. INTRODUCTION


The aim of this manual is to provide you with information and basic instructions
for the correct installation, transport, maintenance and use of your EHR.

It is essential that you carefully read all these safety rules and warnings before,
during and after the start-up of your EHR: only in this way can we guarantee an
optimal, regular service in perfect conditions of reliability and safety.

As this document is generic in nature, it is used for a wide range of products with
a wide variety of options. Components, instructions or safety standards may
appear that do not apply to or are insufficient for the specific equipment you have
purchased. In that case you must assess and determine which instructions are
valid for your equipment, supplementing them if necessary. Please contact Hi­
moinsa’s Technical Department if you have any doubts.

HIPOWER S.L. considers it honest to point out that the validity of the information
described in this manual refers to the date of issuance of the same, since as­
pects such as technological progress and updates of current regulations, may
force us to make modifications without prior notice.

This manual and the rest of the reference documentation are part of the EHR you
have purchased and must be kept and protected against any agent that may de­
teriorate them. This documentation must accompany the equipment when it is
transferred to a new user or owner.

You should always keep this manual close at hand, so you can consult it in case
of doubt. Although the information provided in this manual has been verified in
detail, HIMOINSA declines any responsibility derived from any calligraphic, typo­
graphical or transcription errors.

In accordance with the European Directives concerning the Defence of Consu­
mers and Users, HIMOINSA is excluded from any liability as a result of incorrect

2.4 WARNINGS IN THE EVENT OF MISUSE

The EHR supplied by HIMOINSA is intended for the conversion and optimisation
of electrical energy according to the environmental and operational conditions
and limits indicated or agreed in the contract. Any modification of these condi­
tions and limits must be communicated to the factory directly or through authori­
sed workshops designed to achieve optimal operation and, where appropriate, to
provide new modifications and / or calibrations to the equipment.

The EHR is an energy conversion and optimisation system intended for energy
distribution facilities that must be operated by specialists in accordance with cu­
rrent standards. Although the recharging powers may be lower than those of a
public supply grid, the danger inherent in electric power is the same. The EHR is
a production plant that, in addition to the electrical risks inherent in a power su­
pply from a public supply grid or generator set, is also subject to the dangers de­
rived from lithium batteries (explosion, gassing, spillage).

Any use that has not been previously agreed with HIMOINSA should be conside­
red as improper use and, as such, is not acceptable.

EHR OVERVIEW  | PAG. 8

## 3. EHR OVERVIEW


The EHR is a device that makes it possible to manage energy in stand-alone sys­
tems of gensets and / or renewable energy sources. In addition, when integrated
with diesel generator systems, it optimises efficiency, noise, emissions and fuel
consumption. It should be noted that it is a power generation system designed
for the rental market.

The HICORE energy control module is the brain of the unit, consisting of a control
panel that allows high-level unit supervision, monitoring and control. This control
module, together with the C4CLOUD device that incorporates GPS global positio­
ning technology, makes it possible to record and send data to the EHR PORTAL.

The EHR PORTAL is an energy management platform (EMS) that allows the user
to control and optimise the energy consumed, in addition to monitoring and re­
porting on each equipment or the entire fleet of equipment owned by the user.
This management can be done by both proprietary users and fleet managers and
service engineers.

HICORE provides the best resources to manage your energy storage, allowing you
to get the most out of the system and respond to your customers’ needs more
effectively.

This manual will guide you in the steps required to operate this equipment co­
rrectly and in a safe and efficient way, allowing you to manage the energy savings
that the equipment will provide throughout its operational life.

3.1 OVERVIEW

The EHR equipment is available in several models and different versions are avai­
lable for each of them. The models depend on the apparent power incorporated
by the inverters and as a consequence of the energy available in the batteries.
The versions are differentiated by the possibilities included in each model, in or­
der to adapt to the demands of users.

EHR OVERVIEW  | PAG. 10

As you can see in the “Input and output connectors” section, EHR model ver­
sions may vary depending on the version.

There are several ways to connect external elements to the EHR to adapt it to the
user’s needs. For this purpose, it incorporates a busbar panel and it allows the
direct connection of the primary energy source (input), the installation to be su­
pplied (output) and the grounding system. At the same time, it incorporates
“SOCKET” input and output connectors for a faster connection.

This busbar panel is located behind the lower distribution door. It can be acces­
sed by opening the lock located in the middle of the door.

Once the busbar door is open, the user will only be able to access the connection
terminals of each busbar. Attached below is the layout of each of the busbars.

The grouping of each of the busbars from left to right is indicated below.

- AC terminal output– (N ,L1, L2, L3): To attach 10 mm ring

terminals.

- AC terminal input – (N ,L1, L2, L3): To attach 10 mm ring

- Ground node - Ground connection: To attach 10 mm ring terminals.

It is mandatory to create a connection between the EHR and the ground, always
in compliance with local rules and regulations. Depending on the grounding sys­
tem to be implemented, a connection must be made to the ground or to the EHR.
A chassis plate and a grounding plate are included and, depending on the groun­
ding system to be wired, these plates must be bridged or not.

For a proper connection, one or more grounding rods must be wired. It should be
noted that when a “grounding rod” is mentioned, this refers to a physical groun­
ding connection. It is usually done by placing a copper bar (grounding rod) in the
ground. But depending on the location of the system, it can also be a copper
plate or strip buried in the ground, the water supply grid, or the water pipes of a
house.

EHR equipment allows connection with TNS, TT and the IT grounding system.
Listed below are the steps to follow to connect each of the grounding systems.

UPS function

The EHR can be used as an offline uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In the
event of a grid or power supply failure, the EHR will continue to supply power to
the output loads.

The change of status is less than 20 ms with zero interruption of the output
supply, which means there will be no interruptions in power.

HICORE incorporates an operating mode intended exclusively for this function
(see 5.10 Working modes |  UPS mode). It requires no user intervention and will
continue to power the output until the EHR power storage runs out. If the primary
power supply is detected once again, it will supply power to charge the EHR
battery to ensure it is ready for the next power outage.

Power assist

The Battery Assist (Power Assist) function is automatically activated when
necessary, without the user having to take any action.

The power assist function is activated when the load demand rises above the
input limit of the AC source. When activated, the inverters synchronize with the
AC source and add the power to the incoming power. This feature is useful when
a load demand is needed at intervals that the AC source cannot supply.

Each EHR model has a minimum power value that the primary power supply must
have for the power assist to work. If it doesn’t, the system will not run properly.
Therefore, when choosing the primary power supply, note that these vary
depending on whether it is an electricity distribution grid or a generator set:

· MINIMUM POWER ELECTRICAL GRID

EHR 45
Minimum power GENERATOR SET (kW)

ATTENTION:

The Power Assist (PEAK SAVING) function in combination with a generator set is
limited to these generator set powers and in order to ensure correct use and
avoid oscillations in the genset, it is recommended to perform it on 90% of the
capacity of the generator set.
If the genset power is lower than recommended, HICORE will display an
on-screen warning indicating that the generator set capacity is less than the
minimum value.

parts, hot surfaces, air intakes and live parts.

• Do not leave disassembled parts, tools or any accessories on the

equipment, in its vicinity or inside the EHR.

• Never leave flammable liquids or flammable cloths soaked in liquid

near the equipment (including lamps).

• Take all possible precautions to avoid risks of leakage. Ground the

common point of the EHR designed to be grounded. Ensure that
this grounding has been carried out in accordance with the relevant
regulations. For more information, see Section 6.1.7 General
Guidelines. Grounding.

• Place a "DO NOT MANOEUVRE" sign on all the circuit breakers that

isolate the parts of the installation on which work is to be carried out.

• Install the necessary safety protections on the parts that complete

the installation.

• Isolate all disconnected links and wires. Do not leave the EHR power

terminals exposed.

• Check and ensure that electrical power links and auxiliary services

are performed correctly.

• Make sure that the power cords you install meet the requirements

of the relevant regulations, as the use of inappropriate cables
can cause serious damage to both equipment and people (due to
dangerous electrical conditions).

• Check that the equipment's shutdown devices are in perfect working

order.

• Check that the ventilation is working properly - hot air from the

inverters must be expelled into the atmosphere.

• Locate the position of all fire extinguishers and other protective and

emergency devices and know how they work.

• The power lines that power the equipment must be connected to the

equipment before the equipment is put into operation.

• Stop the EHR immediately if you detect any type of abnormal

operation, such as excessive vibrations, leaks, fumes, or loss of
output power.

• Keep the body doors closed in case it is exposed to the outside.

Otherwise, if it is located in a dry and clean place, you can leave the
doors open.

• Maintain adequate ventilation to ensure that your EHR works properly.

Without this ventilation, accidents or property damage could be
caused.

• Safety labels should be kept clean and in places predetermined by

the manufacturer.

4.3 SAFETY DURING MAINTENANCE

• Any checks and / or maintenance on the EHR must always be carried

out by specialised personnel.

• Maintenance interventions should be performed with the EHR shut

down. If the equipment is shut down after a period of operation,
wait for it to cool down, be careful not to burn yourself, as some
components may be extremely if the equipment has just been shut
down.

• Before operating on any component of the electrical installation, turn

off the equipment (See "6.3 Disconnection of storage equipment").

• Before opening the electrical panel, authorized personnel must

disconnect the equipment (See "6.3 Disconnection of storage

manufacturer. Only use original spare parts. For spare parts, please
only contact authorised spare parts distributors or workshops in the

4.2 SAFETY DURING OPERATION

• Do not allow people who do not know the safety conditions, children

or animals to access the operational area of the EHR.

• The person responsible for operating the EHR must remain alert

and in the necessary conditions for an adequate response and
interpretation. He or she must never operate it while psychically
or mentally fatigued or under the influence of medication, drugs or
alcohol.

• It is recommended that there be a minimum of two people during

operations that may pose a health risk, especially electrical risks.

• Do not touch the EHR, especially the cables, copper terminals, and

exposed connections, while the equipment is running, as they are
live. In the case of electric shock, the first thing to do is to stop
the equipment. If this is not possible, try to free the victim from
the electrical power source using a non-conductive element. If the
victim is partially or totally unconscious, perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) and seek medical assistance immediately.

• Do not touch the equipment until the EHR is completely turned off.

• Never connect loads higher than the POWER RANGE of the EHR.

• The lines of the planned loads to which the generated power will be

supplied must always be connected to the equipment before the
start-up of the equipment.

• Periodically check the battery terminal connections to make sure they

are clean, airtight, and weatherproof.

• Do not make any changes to the DC bus of the batteries. It is enough

to check the DC bus to make sure the terminals are tight enough.

• Battery maintenance should be performed or supervised by personnel

with knowledge of the batteries and the necessary precautions.

• When replacing batteries, make sure they are of the same type and

number.

• Do not throw the batteries into a fire as they can explode. Do not

open or mutilate the batteries as the electrolyte released is harmful
to the skin and eyes.

• Batteries should only be replaced by the manufacturer or authorised

personnel. Handling batteries or control systems can be dangerous
and will invalidate the warranty.

• Batteries in some countries are considered hazardous waste. Use

the appropriate containers or contact an institution responsible for
the collection of this type of waste.

START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 20

## 5. START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR


The installation of the EHR must be carried out by qualified personnel, in accor­
dance with the regulations in force in the country where the installation is to be
carried out.

5.1 INSTALLATION: GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

To carry out the installation, a series of general considerations must be taken
into account, regardless of where the EHR is located. Complemented by the spe­
cific recommendations of each installation, shown in this section..

LOCATION OF THE EHR.

It should be verified that the EHR doors can be fully opened, that access for
maintenance and overhauls is possible, and that the cooling system is working
properly.

The location of the EHR is of utmost importance because the proximity of the
power supply and its grounding point must be taken into account, proper ventila­
tion (leaving at least one meter on all sides of the unit and making sure that the
hot air flows that may be generated by the internal elements are directed away
from the equipment). The unit should be placed upright on a flat, solid surface.
Make sure the unit is not in danger of being submerged in water.

In general, the area where the EHR is installed must be properly fenced off to
prevent access by unauthorised persons. Appropriate prohibition and danger sig­
ns should be placed in visible areas.

VENTILATION

The ventilation of the EHR plays a key role in its proper functioning and durability.

Improper ventilation can cause excessive temperatures around the EHR or inside
the gensets, causing overheating and loss of operational efficiency.

Adequate ventilation should have the following characteristics:

The following premises must be taken into account:

# Page 21


START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 21

people, the electrical installation and the equipment, the customer must ground
the EHR.

To carry out grounding, the EHR contains a main grounding terminal. The custo­
mer shall connect his grounding rod to the grounding installation of the equip­
ment by means of an insulated copper conductor with a minimum section of 16
mm2 or by means of a bare copper conductor with a minimum section of 25
mm2.

The materials, dimensions and depth of the grounding rods must be chosen in
such a way that they resist corrosion and present adequate mechanical resistan­
ce. They should be installed vertically in the ground. The resistance of a groun­
ding rod depends on its dimensions, its shape and the resistivity of the soil in
which it is embedded. This resistivity is usually variable from place to place and
varies with depth.

The choice and sizing of the grounding conductors and rods will be the responsi­
bility of the installer who performs the installation, taking into account the local
and national regulations applicable in their jurisdiction.

OUTDOOR INSTALLATIONS.

After consulting the general installation instructions, shown in the previous sec­
tion, and the corresponding regulations, if the EHR is being installed outside,
special attention should be paid to the noise generated, the environmental condi­
tions and the influence of seasonal and meteorological changes on the characte­
ristics of the soil and the environment.

5.2 PRE-START-UP CHECKS

These operations should be performed in the following situations:

• Before start-up.

• After the installation of the equipment.

• After a general overhaul.

• After performing maintenance operations.

• After a long period of inactivity.

• Heat from other sources should be considered in the design of the

ventilation system.

• The design of the ventilation system of the equipment will be carried

out with all doors closed.

• The EHR will be installed depending on the direction of the prevailing

winds, both indoors and outdoors.

The altitude at which the genset is installed must be taken into account since
the greater the altitude the lower the density of the air, requiring a greater flow of
air than equipment located at sea level.

CONNECTING AND DISCONNECTING THE EQUIPMENT.

Explanation of the equipment connection:

1. Final protocol for the start-up of the equipment.

2. Physical connection steps.

3. Steps to follow to connect batteries, inverters.

The equipment is supplied ready to be connected to users’ loads and power
sources. When making connections, it is necessary to respect the conditions in­
dicated in the diagrams that are supplied with the equipment.

The choice and sizing of the cables is the responsibility of the installer who per­
forms the installation, depending on the type of cable and the current regulations
that are applicable in the country in which the installation is carried out.

Power cables must be connected to the line terminals located at the bottom of
the electrical panel, and must be located in suitable conduits, tunnels or cubicles
carrying protective conductors. It is recommended that cables of different volta­
ges be separated by a minimum distance between layers of 25 cm, always pla­
cing those with the highest voltage in the deepest area, thus avoiding possible
magnetic interference.

GROUNDING (TNS, IT).

Differentiate the TNS, IT for the connection of the equipment and the behaviour
of the equipment with regard to the different grounding systems.

Metal parts of installations that are exposed to contact with people, due to an
insulation defect or accidental causes, could be live. To ensure the protection of

# Page 22


START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 22

Generator set as primary power supply

As per the above diagram, the steps to follow to perform a TNS grounding are as
follows:

1. The ground of the generator set (neutral) and the chassis must be bridged.

2. The ground of the generator set (neutral) and the ground of the EHR must be
connected and wired to a grounding rod.

3. The EHR chassis and the EHR ground must be bridged.

4. There must be a plate connecting the EHR chassis and the EHR ground node.
Electrical distribution grid as primary power supply

1. The grounding of the electrical distribution grid must be bridged with the neu­
tral.

2. The grounding of the electrical distribution grid and the grounding of the EHR
must be attached and wired to a grounding rod (Rod # 1)

5.3 START-UP

Perform all the checks described in the previous sections. Verify that the magne­
tothermal and differential switches are in the OFF position.

NOTE:

It is not recommended that batteries be discharged below 17%, as the unit will
enter standby mode and the procedure described in section 6.1.1 will have to be
applied.

Check the grounding connections of the system. Below we show the most com­
mon grounding system with the connections that should be taken into account:

TT GROUNDING SYSTEM.
Electrical distribution grid as primary power supply

As per the above diagram, the steps to follow to perform a TT grounding are as
follows:

3. The EHR chassis must be connected to an insulated grounding rod (Rod #2)

4. The plate that attaches the chassis to the busbar must be completely clean.

START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 23

When distributing the phases in the busbar, the arrangement of each of them
must be taken into account, since an incorrect phase sequence can set off an
alarm and cause the system to shut down.

When wiring a generator set, the user will not have any problem with the connec­
tion of the phases, since in the output of the generator sets the phase sequence
is indicated, so each phase must be connected respectively. In the opposite
case, when you want to wire an electrical distribution grid, it must be taken into
account that the distribution of phases is not known and that for this reason, the
phases must be changed until the EHR does not show the “ Incorrect phase rota­
tion ” alarm.

An image is provided below that indicates the distribution of phases that must be
wired in the input busbar (busbar on the left)

Once the busbar is wired, you must proceed as indicated in the next section to
perform the input connection routine.

Steps to follow

• Make sure that the AC source to be connected to the unit is turned

off.

• On the HICORE’s built-in display, verify that no operating mode is

1. The EHR chassis and the EHR ground must be bridged. There must be a plate
connecting the EHR chassis and the grounding busbars.

The EHR equipment incorporates two input channels, which are described below:

Primary power supply input

This input is intended for the connection of a generator set or an electrical distri­
bution grid (three-phase), feeding up to a maximum of 100A per phase. This
input can be made in two ways, by busbar or by “SOCKET” connection. To indica­
te the chosen selection, the selector included in the front panel must be changed
to the correct position. In the following image we can see the selector and the
position corresponds to each of the connection modes.

In the panel the selector is identified by Sockets or Busbar

Maintenance input

This input is intended to charge the batteries externally, using a conventional
single-phase power supply from a house. This input powers the batteries up to a
maximum of 16A.

To make a connection from a primary power supply you must abide by the fo­
llowing connection guide, keeping in mind that the phase sequence must be res­
pected.

START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 24

Once the “SOCKET” is wired, the input must be connected to the EHR, and the
steps described below must be followed.

• The HICORE’s built-in display should check that no operating mode

is being performed and that the inverters are turned off. Otherwise,
stop the operating mode being performed and verify that the inverters
are turned off.

• Place the selector in the “ON =” position .

• Connect the “SOCKET” connector of the AC power supply to the

three-phase “SOCKET” input and make the connection as explained
in the “Phase Arrangement” section above .

• If the AC power supply is a generator set with automatic start-up,

connect the generator set start-up control input to the starter relay
connector incorporated in the EHR, see 5.6. EHR control panel .

• Select an operating mode in the HICORE to start the inverters.

• If the AC power supply is a generator set without automatic start-up

or an electrical distribution grid, start or connect the AC source.

• If the AC power supply is the electrical distribution grid, it should be

noted that as the phase distribution is not known, the phases should
be interchanged until the EHR does not show the ““Incorrect phase
rotation” error.

• Connect the maintenance AC power supply connector to the single-

phase “SOCKET” input and make the connection.

• As soon as you make the connection of the EHR equipment, it

automatically detects the operating mode (if it is operational) and
only performs the maintenance charge.

• being performed and that the inverters are turned off. Otherwise,

shut down the operating mode being performed and verify that the
inverters are turned off.

• Place the selector in the “ON - ” position, see 3.2 Identification of the

main components.

• Open the lower distribution door, see 3.2 Identification of the main

components.

• The busbar input connection is on the left. Make sure the supply

terminals are dry, clean any excess moisture with an absorbent cloth.

• Connect the AC power supply connectors to the input busbar and

make the connection as explained in the “ Phase Arrangement ”
section above

• Close the lower distribution door.

connect the generator set start-up control input to the start-up relay
connector that starts the EHR, see 3.2 Identification of the main
components.

If the AC power supply is an electrical distribution grid, you should keep in mind
that as the phase distribution is not known, the phases should therefore be inter­
changed until the EHR does not show the “ Incorrect phase rotation” error.

SOCKET CONNECTION

Phase arrangement
As mentioned above, since the EHR equipment incorporates a power input through
the “” connector, this input allows the connection of the primary power supply
quickly. Just as the connection by busbar must take into account the distribution
of the phases, when connecting to an elective generator set, the user will not
have any problems as the phases are marked and the sequence is known. If you
want to wire the electrical distribution grid, it should be borne in mind that as the
phase distribution is not known, the phases must therefore be interchanged until
the EHR does not show the “Incorrect phase rotation” error.

An image is provided below that indicates the distribution of the phases to be
wired in the input “SOCKET”.

Delay in start-up .

This delay allows for brief “false start” signals and can last up to five seconds.
When used with a hybrid unit, it is important that the diesel engine starts imme­
diately. Whenever possible, this delay should be eliminated.

Preheating delay, safety ignition timer and heating timer.

Always try to reduce delays to the minimum accepted level.

the operating mode being performed and verify that the inverters are
turned off.

• Open the lower distribution door see 3.2 Identification of the main

disconnect the generator set start-up control input from the starter
relay connector incorporated in the EHR, see 3.2 Identification of the
main components.

• The bus output bar is on the right. Make sure the supply terminals

are dry, clean any excess moisture with an absorbent cloth.

• Connect the AC output charging connectors to the output terminals

and make the connection

connect the generator set start-up control input to the start-up relay
connector that incorporates the EHR, see 3.2 Identification of the
main components.

CONNECTION OF DC INPUTS (SOLAR)

It is advisable to make the connection of the solar connectors when the equip­
ment is turned off or when it is not performing any operating mode. Remember
that the “array” of solar panels for each of the connectors that you integrate into
the EHR must have the following limiting characteristics

Open Circuit Voltage (Voc) [V]
240

Short circuit current (Isc) [A]
23

EHR models include a maximum of 6 solar inputs (depending on the model). So­
lar panels connected to each of these inputs must meet the above specifica­
tions. If these limits are not respected and solar panels with much higher specifi­
cations are installed, the EHR equipment may suffer the risk of fire.

5.3.1. CONNECTING TO A GENERATOR SET.

A remote generator start-up function is provided to automatically control a gene­
rator set. The start and stop conditions are automatically performed in each of
the operating modes, depending on the source intended to power the load.

*NOTE:

The minimum capacity accepted by the system will be 10kw per genset

Connecting the automatic start-up of a generator set.

The generator set’s remote start-up terminals are located on the lower door. This
is the connection that is used to send a start or stop signal to a generator set
using its automatic start-up cable. EHRs include these connectors so that a pro­
per connection is made with whatever genset the user owns.

When setting up a hybrid system, the overall performance of combining an EHR
with a generator set can be improved by making some simple adjustments to the
type of generator set.

In auto-start mode, some types of generator sets start running as soon as a
start signal is received. Others, however, have a number of delays that can pre­
vent a diesel generator set from starting up and generating power as quickly as
possible. These delays should be minimised whenever possible. Otherwise, the
operation of the operating modes will not be 100% effective.

The routine of starting and shutting down the equipment should be carried out at
specific times when the user deems it convenient. The current arrangement of
EHR equipment is made so as not to have to perform this routine, since the bat­
tery panel is difficult to access, which means that this routine must be performed
by the technicians who operate the machine or the owners of the EHR equipment
themselves.

Once all connections are completed, the unit is ready to perform a full start-up.
Proceed as follows.

# Page 27


START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 27

To restart the EHR plant, you need to proceed as follows:

1. Go to the settings screen and tap “VE. Reset”

2. Then press the Start button for about 10 seconds

3. When it is observed that the equipment has been completely turned off, press
the start button again for about 10 seconds.

4. When you see that the control panel has started up, the equipment will restart
completely.

If an emergency occurs and the unit needs to be turned off, press the emergency
stop button located on the top of the EHR equipment, s ee 5.6. EHR control panel .
The unit shuts down immediately. To reset the EHR equipment , the emergency
stop button must be disengaged by turning it clockwise.

WARNING:

As the activation of the emergency button causes the equipment to shut down,
when an emergency stop is real, the “Emergency shutdown” alarm and “Devices
off” will appear at the same time.

Once the issue has been fixed, follow the instructions in section 8. Start-up and
operation of the EHR..

5.4 CHECKS AFTER THE START-UP OF THE EHR

The following checks must be carried out:

• Electrical checks (voltage, intensity, frequency, etc.).

• Mechanical checks (tightening screws, sockets, etc.).

• Safety checks (emergency stop, magnetothermal switch, differential

switch, etc.).

5.5 START-UP SEQUENCE FOR EHR

EHRs are equipped with an electronic protection and control centre, the characte­
ristics of which are defined in the appropriate sections (See “7.5. Quick Guide to
Using the EHR Plant”). Also included is a protective dashboard (fuses, magneto­
thermal switches, differentials...), voltage switch elements and input/output con­
nection terminals

In an EHR plant, operations and equipment operating statuses are displayed with
a set of light, text, and graphic indicators. For information on these and other
instructions and operations, please refer to the relevant documentation at EHR
headquarters.

When a new unit is shipped, it is completely disconnected for safety reasons.
When starting the unit up for the first time, the following steps must be followed
in the correct orde r.

1. Check that all battery-inverter insulators (rotary switches located under the in­
verters) are in the “OFF” position (note that, depending on the configuration of
the unit, the insulators can be accessed from either of the side door s).

2. Check that the switches on the front of each inverter are in the “OFF” position.

3. The control panel switch, located on the control panel must be in the “OFF”
positi on.

4. Open the two lower side doors covering the battery section.

5. Set the battery-inverter insulators (rotary switches located under the inverters)
to “ON” and wait 20 seconds. You will need the key for this.

6. Press the AC on/off switch that turns one of the batteries on. This switch is
located on each of the battery modules used to turn on all the batteries in the
unit.

7. Press the red button on battery number one for several seconds (this will be
indicated).

8. Wait approximately 2 minutes until all battery status LEDs are green. (They
don’t have to be steady; they can flash at random to signal communication be­
tween batteries.)

9. Set the switches on the front panel of each inverter to “ ON”

10. On the control panel, turn the switch to “ON” to initialise the control panel.

11. Close the battery compartment and inverter access doors.

12. If the SoC of the unit is less than 90%, the batteries will be in standby mode
and therefore the control panel will not start. Refer to the manual to perform a
maintenance charge to stabilise the batteries at 100% of the SoC. See section
5.9. Emergency battery charging (SoC <10%).

13. The unit is now initialised. Refer to the user manual for instructions on how
to configure and operate it instructions.

Next, we will select the desired mode of operation: the description of the modes
of operation are indicated in 3.2. Operating modes.

If you want to “ CHARGE THE BATTERIES ” you must indicate the type of charge to
be used, whether a fast charge or a maintenance charge.

5.9 CHARGE BATTERIES

If you have selected “ START UP ” you have to indicate what the system’s primary
power source is, whether a generator set or an electrical distribution grid or wi­
thout an energy source (ISLAND).

Once you have indicated the primary power source, the maximum power of that
source will be configured. This data will allow the EHR to control the system to
improve the efficiency of the primary energy source and increase its useful life as
in the case of generator sets. If it has been previously selected that the EHR is
not a power supply (ISLAND) it will not be necessary to configure the maximum
power of the primary power source, as it does not exist.

LOW LOADS mode. The battery is enabled and beyond a certain power, the bat­
tery is disconnected and the generator or the grid is connected.

To select each of these modes, you must select the one you want to use. Next,
you have to indicate the corresponding configuration data and finally press
“ START ”. If we want to finish this operation we must click on the “ASSISTANT “
button that will take us to the tab of the operating mode that is currently running
and all we will have to do is press “ STOP ”.

All operating modes include a help function to advise the user at all times. To
access this content, you just have to click on the “HELP” button, whose status
LED will have started flashing beforehand to indicate that help is available.

If you are charging a battery, it will not be possible to activate the operating
modes, the charging must be disabled and then you can activate the desired
operating mode.

Remember that to change the operating mode it will be necessary to press
“STOP ” to halt the operating mode that is currently being used.

In all hybrid working modes that combine the grid / generator set with the
batteries, the minimum power delivered by the batteries in any case will be 5Kw.

During the charging process in each working mode, the charge will be limited to
the absorption phase of the battery; this means that the battery will be conside­
red fully charged around 97%. To make a 100% charge you must access the
battery charging menu.

If no primary power supply (ISLA ) has been chosen beforehand , the only avail­
able operating mode will be “ PLUG & PLAY” because it is not possible to
intelligently combine battery charging and charging power using a primary power
supply.

5.10 WORKING MODES

The EHR integrates several operating modes aimed at adapting to all the work
scenarios that may occur in the electrical system, allowing greater performance
and greater adaptability of the equipment currently available in the installations.

PLUG & PLAY mode. The use of the battery and the generator set or grid is
enabled dynamically.

UPLOAD SHARE mode. Grid usage is enabled at the same time as battery
usage.

Power Booster mode. Only available for genset connection. Working mode
designed for starting electric engines.

UPS mode. Only available for grid connection. When the primary power supply
is disconnected, the battery will be connected.

PEAK SAVING mode. The generator set or the grid is enabled up to a single
power. Beyond this power, any additional energy needed will be delivered by
the battery.

START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 32

“ PLUG & PLAY ” is the default mode for the EHR equipment. The intention is to
offer the user a way that avoids having to insert configuration parameters and it
incorporates a wide functionality to adapt to most applications. This mode de­
pends on the previous configuration that has been made on the equipment,
distinguishing between two functionalities:

When the electricity distribution grid or a generator set has been selected as
the primary energy source.

In this case the “PLUG & PLAY” mode will act intelligently by combining three ope­
rating modes:

•	LOW LOADS

•	UPS

•	PEAK SAVING

Thus, for an initial moment in which the loads present at the output are low, the
equipment will operate in “ LOW LOADS ” mode, until the threshold defined by de­
fault is exceeded. This threshold is defined as 30% of the maximum power that
the generator set or the electricity supply grid can supply. If it is working without
any load at all, the EHR will take advantage of this moment to charge the batte­
ries. Once this threshold has been crossed, the generator set will start up or the
grid input will be enabled to power the output and charge the batteries if neces­
sary. It should be noted that the genset will continue to work only with the grid or
generator set until the maximum performance power of the generator set is rea­
ched, which will be given as 90% of the maximum power that the generator set
can supply. If the grid is chosen, this threshold will be given by the maximum
power selected by the user. Once this power is reached, the “ PEAK SAVING ”
function will be performed, which means that the power of the generator set or
grid will be limited to that value while the peaks present at the output will be
powered by batteries or by work batteries and the generator set or the grid toge­
ther.

When no primary power supply has been selected, the system will operate in
island mode

In this case, the “PLUG & PLAY” mode will only work with batteries, supplying the
load by batteries and if using renewable energies, it will charge the batteries and
at the same time discharge them to power the load. This mode is recommended
for specific uses with very low consumption as this will be when the system

Depending on which primary input source you select, the available applications
will change:

stops due to a low state of charge.

In any case, to run this mode of operation you just have to select it and then
press “ START ”.

When the battery SoC falls below 20%, the EHR will operate at 100% with the
generator set or grid until the charging stage is completed. Once the batteries
are fully charged, the equipment returns to normal operation. This is the case if
we are working in “ LOW LOADS” mode . When this condition occurs during
“ PEAK SAVING ” or “ UPS ” mode, the equipment will shut down in the “PLUG &
PLAY” mode.

Whenever the generator set is turned on or the power grid is enabled, there will
be a minimum battery-only operating time until the inverters synchronise with
the wave from the connected source.

When starting this operating mode, there will be a delay of [5 – 30] s until the
EHR output is enabled.

RECOMMENDATION:

When a mode shutdown occurs due to an unwanted SoC (<20%), it is necessary
to fully charge the batteries externally using maintenance or fast charging. This
value may vary slightly by up to 17% by the hysteresis programmed into the
system.

5.10.4. LOAD SHARING.

This mode is intended to allow energy sources to work in parallel exclusively with
the power grid, as well as the battery. To achieve this function, the user must in­
dicate the percentage (%) of energy that he or she wants to feed through the grid,
since the rest of the energy will be provided by the battery.

Once this configuration is made, the system will adapt by feeding the load pre­
sent at the output, with the proportion chosen by the user. This mode of opera­
tion is useful to take advantage of solar energy, since on sunny days with the
usual demand for energy, the load present at the output can be fed with a propor­
tion of generator set or grid and the rest will be provided by solar energy (if it is
greater than the demand, it will charge the batteries and if it is lower, the battery
will provide the missing power). When the maximum threshold of supply power,
configured by the user, is exceeded, the input will be limited to that value and the
rest of the energy will be provided by the battery.

To execute this mode of operation it is necessary to insert the percentage (%) of
energy contributed by the grid and then press “ START ”. Below we can see some
images that show us what this screen looks like.

In all EHR models, this is a minimum grid supply value. This minimum value
depends on the chosen EHR model, see 4.6. Electrical assistance. The EHR will
ignore the percentage selected by the user until that threshold is exceeded.

When the battery SoC drops below 20%, the equipment operates with a 100%
percentage of the grid until the charging stage is complete. Once the charging is
complete, the equipment returns to normal operation.

5.10.5. UPS

This mode is intended to achieve uninterrupted power at the output. To do this,
the EHR equipment supplies the loads through a generator set or grid and if
the primary power supply disappears, the charge is instantly supplied by the
batteries. When the maximum supply power threshold set by the user is exceed­
ed, the input will be limited to that power value and the batteries will provide the
missing power.

To run this mode of operation you just have to select it and then press “ START ”.

When the battery SoC decreases by 20%, the equipment will perform a “UPS”
mode shutdown.

When a mode shutdown occurs due to an unwanted SoC (<20%), it is necessary
to fully charge the batteries externally using maintenance or power input.

This mode is intended to feed the loads present at the output only by a generator
set or grid, except when there are large energy demands, higher than those that
can be provided by the generator set or grid. In this case, a limitation on the input
is established and the demand for extra energy is delivered by the batteries. You
can set the maximum desired power to be provided by the generator set or the
grid (this value will be limited to that indicated as the maximum power of the
generator set or electrical grid , since this power must never be exceeded). It
is important to size the generator set to avoid oscillations, being the minimum
group power of the same capacity of the EHR to be used (recommended 30%
higher) and perform the PEAK SAVING from 90% of its nominal power. If the value
is lower, the system will indicate that the connected group is not powerful enough
for this application.

To run this mode of operation it is necessary to insert the maximum power that
will be provided by the generator set or the grid and then press “ START ”. Below
we can see some images that show us what this screen looks like.

When the battery SoC decreases by 20%, the equipment exits “PEAK SAVING”
mode.

When starting this operating mode there will be a delay of [5 – 30]s until the
EHR output is enabled.

When performing a mode shutdown due to an unwanted SoC (<20%), it is
necessary to fully charge the batteries externally using maintenance or power

input.

This mode is intended to power low loads only by battery, except when the energy
demand exceeds a power threshold determined by the user, in which case the
generator set is started up or the grid is enabled to work fully with this power
source. When the maximum power threshold, set by the user, is exceeded, the
input will be limited to this value and additional power will be provided by the
batteries.

To run this mode of operation it is necessary to insert the maximum power at
which it is powered by batteries and then press “ START ”. Below we can see some
images that show us what this screen looks like.

When the battery SoC is 20%, the equipment will operate at 100% with the
generator set or grid until the charging stage is completed. Once the charging is
complete, the equipment returns to normal operation.

Whenever the generator set is turned on or the power grid is enabled, there will
be a minimum operating time.

5.10.8. POWER BOOSTER

In this working mode, we take advantage of the overload capacity of the batteries
to absorb the power peaks in the load. We configure the minimum state of char­
ge level so that, beyond this level, the generator set starts up.

Once you have selected the level of charge status of the SoC batteries with the
help of the cursors ( ) and once you have made the connections, don’t forget to
press “START”.

NAVIGATION

The initial tab allows users to visualise the most important information and thus
be able to observe the power flows in a clear and graphic way.

This screen is the default for the EHR equipment and whenever possible the
equipment will display it on the screen. If you want to access it quickly, you just
need to press the “main menu” button.

In the main menu you can see what energy sources are available, how they are
distributed and the amount of energy that is being produced and consumed. As
you can see, the central graphic, represented as “HICORE”, refers to the control
unit of the EHR which is responsible for managing all the operations and scenari­
os that the EHR will encounter.

As you can see in the picture, we have three power supplies here, namely:

•	Primary power supply, either the electrical distribution grid or a

generator set.

•	Renewable energies, currently only input from solar panels is

available.

•	T his power supply will therefore always be available until it runs

out, as it is integrated into the EHR equipment.

If you have selected the generator set option, the data to be displayed will be the
same, although HICORE will make the appropriate adjustments to allow for a
power supply such as a generator set.

In this screen you can see the information generated by the installed solar pa­
nels. We can see the following data:

•	Solar panel current (A)

•	-Solar panel voltage (V)

On this screen you can see the current status of the battery pack. We may see
four possible scenarios:

STATE OF CHARGE

On this screen you can see the current state of charge (SoC %), the power with
which the battery block is being charged and the corresponding energy. The time
remaining until the batteries are fully charged (at the current charging power) is
also indicated.

You can view the battery status graphically and easily from the battery icon. Set
out below are all the possible statuses of the battery while it is being charged.

STATE OF DISCHARGE

On this screen you can see the state of charge at the time of the consultation
(SoC %), the power with which the battery block is being discharged and the cor­
responding energy. It also indicates the time remaining until the batteries are
completely discharged or the autonomy time (at the current discharge power).

The discharge will be indicated by two battery icons that will warn the user of the
approximate state of discharge.

IDLE STATUS

This screen indicates that the battery is idle, that is, it is neither charging nor
discharging. This status can only appear when no operating mode is running or
when the battery is fully charged, and the output is powered only by a generator
set or an electrical distribution grid

SHUTDOWN STATUS

This display indicates that the battery has a SoC of less than 20% and therefore
the batteries must be charged. When the user observes this battery status, he or
she can perform a charge immediately.

This screen shows the information generated by the electrical installation to be
powered or “ Charged ”. In this tab you can see the following data:

•	Total current consumed (A)

•	Primary power source power (kW)

•	Battery power (kW)

•	Solar panel power (kW)

•	Battery life with current discharge power (h)

START-UP AND OPERATION OF THE EHR | PAG. 41

The EHR incorporates the possibility of configuring an operational calendar. This
functionality is very useful if you want to restrict the operation of the machine
when it is being used by third-party users. To configure the calendar, the user
must indicate the days of the week, the time slot and the maximum power at
which he or she wants to allow the use of the EHR

Once the calendar has been configured, the user can only use the machine in the
configured time slot and when this slot is exceeded, a system shutdown will oc­
cur to indicate to the user that they have exceeded the enabled operating time.
This will take place in the same way for the output power, since if the user ex­
ceeds the configured power, the system will shut down immediately, indicating to
the user that they have exceeded the configured power.

If the calendar is active in the main menu, an image of a calendar will appear,
thus indicating to the user that the use of the EHR is limited, and it may be the
case that the machine cannot work because it is outside the configured time
slot.

The “CALENDAR” icon will appear in light grey when the option is enabled and in

dark grey when we are within the time slot in which the EHR has been configured.

Remember to disable calendar ticks when you do not want to restrict the
operation. Whenever one of these “ticks” is enabled , the calendar will be
enabled, which will make it impossible for the equipment to operate outside the
configured time slot.

Remember to set a high enough power to supply the desired installation as
insufficient power would cause the system to shut down immediately.

In this screen we can modify internal parameters of the control panel, such as
the time, date, language or the necessary settings for the grid generated by the
EHR equipment

When an alarm or warning occurs, the LED beside the “ ALARMS AND WARNINGS”
button will light up. When a warning or alarm occurs, the LED will flash but when
the user enters the “ALARMS AND WARNINGS” screen, the LED will remain on all
the time.

By pressing the button, you will be able to see what alarms and warnings are
running at that moment. However, if we go to the alarm history, we can see up to
the last 30 alarms and warnings that have occurred throughout the operation of
the machine.

MAINTENANCE | PAG. 44

## 6. MAINTENANCE


A proper maintenance and overhaul programme, performed only by qualified
technicians, is essential if you wish to maximise inverter/battery reliability,
minimise repairs and reduce long-term costs.

To carry out an effective maintenance programme, we recommend that you
collect the data that are obtained during the work performed, using the EHR
uptime meter to keep an accurate record of all the services performed. This
record will also be important for security purposes.

To see the specific maintenance plans for the EHR you have purchased, please
refer to the corresponding documentation. These plans vary depending on:

• Hours of operation

• Machine location

• Type of load it supplies

• Environmental conditions

In this way, once the equipment has been received and taking into account the
aforementioned elements, these maintenance plans must be studied to
determine how often maintenance needs to be carried out.

It is important to clean the EHR continuously and to also avoid the accumulation
of liquids on both internal and external surfaces. Do not use flammable solvents
when carrying out cleaning tasks; it is recommended that you use aqueous
liquids for industrial cleaning.

IMPORTANT:

Before performing any operation, shut down the EHR and wait until it cools
down.

The EHR requires a regular storage maintenance load when not in use. Connect
it to an AC source all the time or at least every 4 weeks, ensuring that a full
charge is maintained.

Battery maintenance charging must be done from a single-phase charging source,
an electrical grid or a diesel generator set.

# Page 45


MAINTENANCE | PAG. 45

5. Turn the AC source switch on.

It is recommended that you leave the AC power supply constantly plugged in. If
this is not possible, to maintain the product warranty it is necessary to charge
the EHR unit at least every 4 weeks.

BATTERY DISCHARGES BELOW 10%

When the battery is discharged to 100% (0% SoC) follow these steps:

This procedure should only be performed by qualified personnel.

1. Turn the battery-inverter disconnector switches off; you will need a key for this.

2. Push the continuous disconnector (DC) switch down.

3. Open the lower side panels to access the batteries.

4. Click the ON switch on each of the batteries and turn all the batteries in the
unit on.

5. Press the SW button on battery No. 1 and wait for all batteries to start.

6. Connect the external DC power supply to the DC distribution bar

7. Set the power supply to 55 V and let the batteries charge until the voltage
reaches 51 V.

8. If there is a module with the red ERR LED flashing, that module or modules
should be charged individually following this procedure:

a.	 Turn all the modules off by pressing the red button on battery

number one for a few seconds (this battery will be indicated); then
press each individual kill switch.

b.	 Disconnect the power cords from the alarmed module. Isolate the

terminals from the wires to avoid short circuits.

c.	 Disconnect the communication cables.

d.	 Connect the DC power supply to the DC+ and DC- terminals

e.	 Set the power supply to 55 V and charge the modules until the

voltage reaches 51 V.

EHR equipment requires a regular maintenance load when not in use, to preserve
its storage capacity. To do this, you should connect an AC source to the
maintenance "SOCKET" all the time or at least once a week. In this way it is
necessary to maintain a full load and to ensure that the equipment retains all its
accumulation capacity.

The maintenance load must be carried out from a single-phase source, either a
grid or a single-phase generator set. Remember that we can only supply batteries
up to 16A AC through this input.

While the unit is charged, a constant single-phase AC supply must be connected
to the maintenance input. The procedure for the maintenance load is as follows:

1. On the HICORE home screen press the "ASSISTANT" button

2.  Specify that you want to perform a charge.

3. Specify that you want to perform a maintenance load

4. Connect the AC source to the mounting input connector on the maintenance
panel. For more information about the location of this connector, see 5.6. EHR
control panel.

5. Press "RUN"

6. The unit should now charge at low speed to prevent the battery from running
out.

For more information, please refer to point 5.9. Battery charging.

6.1 BATTERY MAINTENANCE

While the unit is charged, a constant single-phase AC supply must be connected
to the maintenance input. Follow this procedure for the maintenance load:

1. On the CORE home screen, press the "System Switch" button to turn the
inverters off.

2.  Turn the output switch off.

3. Connect the AC source to the mounting input connector on the maintenance
control panel.

4. On the central home screen, press the "System Switch" button to turn the
inverters on.

a decrease in the autonomy of the batteries). The procedure for disconnection
due to the failure of a battery module is as follows:

16. See if the control panel is displaying an alarm or a warning related to the
battery error, see 7. Warning and Alarms.

17. Disconnect the HDI by following the procedure in section EHR shutdown
procedure.

18. Disconnect the power cords from the faulty battery bank module. To proceed
with the disconnection, remove the battery’s P+ and P- power terminals. To do
this, click on the push button located on each of the connectors and remove it
from the connection terminal.

19. Make sure the power connectors are properly insulated and secure once
removed, as there is a high potential risk of short circuiting if either of these
terminals touch any part of the unit.

20. Connect the DC power supply to the DC+ and DC terminals.

21. Set the power supply to 55 V and charge the modules until the voltage
reaches 51 V.

22. If it is properly charged, it should be returned to the battery bank; to do this,
please follow the procedure set out in EHR Shutdown procedure.

23. If the battery has not been charged properly, the battery should be replaced
with a new one (make sure the same battery model is used).

f.	Reconnect the battery modules to the system by reconnecting the

power cords and communication cables.

g.	Click the ON button. All the modules should be activated.

1. All system modules should have the SoC indicator LEDs on and flashing in
green without any ERROR or ALARM LEDs.

2. Disconnect the DC power supply.

3. Wait until the BMU LED stops flashing and remains solid green. This may take
several minutes.

4. Check that the LEDs on each of the battery modules are now also solid green
and are not flashing.

5. Press the red button on battery number one (it will be indicated) for 2s. This
will turn the batteries off again.

6. Battery-inverter insulators (rotary switches located under the inverters) can be
set to "ON" and then you have to wait 20 seconds; the key is needed to do this.

7. Press the red button on battery number one for several seconds (it will be
indicated).

8. Wait about 2 minutes.

9. When you see that all the battery status LEDs are green, we can continue.

10. Turn on the automatic continuous power (DC) switch intended to power the
system control.

11. Connect a power supply to the AC-IN input to the EHR.

12. Perform a maintenance load, see Battery Charging section.

13. The EHR should begin charging the batteries. Allow the unit to reach a charge
of 100%.

14. Once the battery's SoC level has reached 100%, close the side door panels.

15. The unit is now initialised. Refer to the user manual for setup and operating

instructions.

ALARM IN A BATTERY STRING MODULE

If the operation of one of the battery modules encounters an alarm (indicated by
a flashing red LED), it is best to disconnect this battery from the system and
continue working with the rest of the batteries (remember that this action causes

# Page 47


MAINTENANCE | PAG. 47

1. Perform a battery maintenance charge until a 100% state of charge is rea­
ched.

2. To maintain the product warranty it is necessary to perform a maintenance
load of the EHR unit at least every 4 weeks.

6.2 RECOMMENDED INSPECTION OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT

Checks should be carried out on returned units to ensure that the EHR is in good
condition.
Subsequent inspection:

•	All housings are free of dust, dirt or scratches.

•	All necessary screws are in place and tightened tightly.

•	The lifting terminal is tightened to the correct torque (250 Nm).

•	Keys are in place.

•	All doors except the upper front one are locked.

•	The battery bank has a SoC ≥ 99%

•	The INVERTER DC disconnectors are in the right position.

•	The unit can be turned off and on by selecting operating modes on the HICO­

RE. Leave the unit off.

•	The control panel and EHR are properly connected and the SIM card contains

data.

•	Check any alarms produced during the rental period. See 7. Warning and

•	Update the HICORE time if necessary.

•	Check the air filters and replace them if they are dirty.

•	Return the unit to the default settings via HICORE. This action will delete any

configurations that have been made and any alarms and logs that have been
produced.

BATTERY BALANCING.

If a battery module is changed, the module must be balanced before it is
integrated into the EHR system. To do this, please follow these steps carefully.

1. Leave the EHR equipment in "STAND BY" (no operating or charging mode is
running)

2. Measure the voltage on the DC busbar.

3. Measure the voltage between the terminals of the new battery module

4. If the voltage of the busbar is higher than the voltage of the new module, the
module must be charged externally up to the voltage measured in the busbar DC.

5. If the voltage measured in the DC busbar is lower than that measured in the
new module, the EHR batteries must be discharged to the voltage measured in
the new battery module. For this it is advisable to use the "LOW LOADS" mode
with a small discharge power ([1 – 2] kW), see 3.2.5. LOW LOADS mode.

6. Once the voltage is equalised, the new module can be connected to the other
batteries. To do this, the shutdown procedure must be carried out beforehand,
see EHR shutdown procedure section.

7. The module can then be inserted and the P+ and P- power cables and then the
communications cables can be connected.

8. After the connection is made, you can continue with the start-up procedure,
see EHR start-up procedure.

9. The unit is now initialised. Refer to the user manual for configuration and
operating instructions.

STORAGE MAINTENANCE

The procedure for performing rotational storage maintenance is:

# Page 48


MAINTENANCE | PAG. 48

7. Turn the disconnectors between each of the inverters and the battery off (they
are located beneath the inverters on the motherboard).  Please note that depen­
ding on the configuration of the unit, the insulators can be accessed from either
side door.

8. Remove the lower side panels that cover the battery sections on either side of
the unit by unscrewing the 3 M6 hexagonal head bolts hidden inside the unit.

9. Set the on/off power switch on each of the batteries to off. This switch is inte­
grated into all battery modules so that each battery module can be turned off.

10. Make sure all BMU battery modules, DC-DC converter, modem, and C2CLUD
are turned off. No LEDs should be flashing inside the unit.

11. Verify that there is no voltage on the DC busbar.

12. Replace the lower side panels of the battery and close the upper side doors

13. The unit is now completely disabled.

Follow the EHR start-up procedure when you turn the unit back on.

If all of the above points are satisfied, the unit will be ready for storage, see 4.
Unloading, handling and transport. The default settings can be restored via HICO­
RE as follows:

1. Go to the " Configuration" screen

2. Navigate to the " Configuration" indicator

3. Navigate to the "Trash can" icon

4. Click on "OK"

6.3 DISCONNECTION OF STORAGE EQUIPMENT

FOR THE INSTALLER

The EHR should always be kept on and charged. However, if the unit is to be shi­
pped, transported, or cannot be accessed due to maintenance for more than 4
weeks, the batteries must be turned off to avoid excessive discharge. The fo­
llowing steps must be followed in the correct order:

1. Make sure the EHR is 100% charged.

2. Finish the charging or mode of operation that is being performed. Make sure
that the HICORE home screen shows "STAND BY".

3. Use the start-up button to turn the control panel off (press for 5 seconds).

4. Disconnect all system inputs and outputs.

5. Open the doors of the EHR and you will see a switch on the panel of each of
the inverters. This switch must be in the "OFF" position (at the switching mi­
dpoint).

6. Push the continuous disconnector (DC) switch down

There are two filters in your EHR. One is located on the back of the EHR just be­
fore the HCVA G3 ventilation fans (see image below):

And the second filter, a type G4 panel filter, is located in the air inputs on both
sides (image below).

Please check the condition of the filter regularly, according to the operating condi­
tions of the unit

WARNING AND ALARMS | PAG. 50

## 7. WARNING AND ALARMS


This section describes the alarms and warnings that may occur during the opera­
tion of the EHR equipment. These alarms must be heeded and as far as possible
resolved, which is why a comment is attached next to each alarm and warning to
guide the user when he or she has to resolve said alarm or warning. Whenever
an alarm occurs, the system will shut down the operating mode and until this
alarm is dealt with and resolved it will not be able to use the EHR equipment
again. To differentiate between an alarm and a warning, an on-screen abbrevia­
tion is used, thus:


table: Table 1
columns: Subject, Abbreviation
rows:
Warning, E
Alarm, S


To solve the alarms it is of vital importance to attend to the block in which they
are generated. We can distinguish between 4 fundamental blocks:


table: Table 2
columns: Subject, Abbreviation
rows:
Inverters, Y
Battery, B
Renewable, R
Central, C


This classification gives us an approximation of where the problem occurs and
how to deal with it. Certain alarms and warnings appear more readily than others
and these are explained below in more detail.

We label these warnings and alarms as frequent, but most of them appear when
the equipment is under stress and we are approaching its maximum capabilities.
Below is a small table that lists the alarms and warnings that occur most fre­
quently and then explains why they occur.

Keep in mind that these warnings and alarms are not the only ones in the sys­
tem. The list of these can be seen in section 7. Warning and Alarms.

These warnings and alarms will be described below. We will list the warnings
first.

HIGH INVERTER TEMPERATURE (WARNING #1)

There are two possible causes:

1. Very high ambient temperature: Therefore, the inverters are cooled down at
too hot a temperature, thereby causing a decrease in performance.

2. Very high inverter power: This causes the inverters to heat up internally, since
although the ventilation is adequate, with an ambient temperature above 30°C it
is very likely that this warning will appear. It should be noted that this only ha­
ppens when we approach the inverter limits.

The activation of this warning falls on the temperature wing. With more or less
time depending on the power that is being inverted and the ambient temperature
at that time.

It is advisable to deal with this warning when it appears in order to prevent the
temperature alarm from occurring as per the help functions shown on the screen.
These can also be seen in 7. Warning and alarms.

WARNING AND ALARMS | PAG. 52

of charge presented by the batteries (SoC) is low. Prompt loading or maintenance
is recommended when this warning occurs.

Depending on the operating mode that is currently running, the battery charge
will run automatically or not when the SoC is less than 20%. For more informa­
tion, see 5.10 Working modes.

THE EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN TURNED OFF BECAUSE ONE OF THE PHASES HAS
BEEN TURNED OFF (ALARM #1)

This alarm occurs for several reasons, as it indicates that the master phase has
either been deactivated for system security reasons or due to repeated shut­
down of the equipment. When the emergency mushroom is pressed, this alarm
appears with the "Emergency Mushroom" alarm, since the emergency mushroom
causes a shutdown of the master phase of the equipment and performs an im­
mediate system shutdown. Another cause can be when there is an unsafe condi­
tion for the equipment, for example when there is a very high overload, and the
machine shuts down suddenly; in most cases the alarm will appear due to the
shutdown and this alarm.

If this alarm is caused by pressing on the mushroom, disengaging it will suffice,
but if this alarm occurs because of any other reason and continues to run conti­
nuously, the system should be reset. For more information, see 5.10 Working
modes.

NOT ALL EXPECTED ELEMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE SYSTEM (ALARM
#2)

This alarm occurs when the system loses communication with one of the inver­
ters, either L1, L2 or L3. Communication with the inverter can fail for several rea­
sons, including:

- False contacts in the DC distribution of the inverter in question,

either due to the "battery switch" or incorrect tightening torques
on the terminals.

- Poor connection of the communication cables between the

inverters and the L1 inverter to the Cerbo GX, due to a worn RJ45
connector or a broken.

- One of the inverters is defective and has stopped working due to

internal causes.

LOW BATTERY (WARNING #2)

This warning occurs when the battery voltage begins to decrease below a given
threshold; this warning does not give rise to any problems as when the SoC is
less than 20% a shutdown occurs, and the safety margins are therefore adequa­
te.

If this warning does appear, it is telling the user that the battery is running low.
For more information, see 7. Warning and alarms.

OUTPUT OVERLOAD (WARNING #3)

This warning occurs when a high inversion is being made, close to the limits pre­
sented by the EHR. It is directly related to the temperature warning, since when
an overload warning occurs and the ambient temperature is high, the system
tends to increase its internal temperature and produces a temperature warning.
If it occurs the other way round, the behaviour is similar: when a temperature
warning occurs the system tends to worsen the performance and the EHR increa­
ses the inversion power causing an overload warning. For more information on
nominal inversion power values as a function of ambient temperature, see 3.3.
Technical characteristics.

The activation of this warning stems from the overload alarm. With more or less
time depending on the power that is being inverted and the ambient temperature
at that moment.

INCORRECT PHASE ROTATION (WARNING #7)

This warning appears when the EHR equipment tries to synchronise with the grid
and cannot do so because the phase sequence is invalid, that is, it informs the
user that the connected phase sequence (either busbar or "SOCKET") is not sui­
table (it performs the function of a phasemeter). When this warning appears, the
user must shut the EHR equipment down, reverse the sequence of a couple of
phases and then reassemble the system and the EHR should be ready to syn­
chronise with the grid.

For more information, please refer to the on-screen help or see 7. Warning and
almars.

LOW SOC STATUS (WARNING #10, WARNING #11 AND WARNING #12)

This warning appears when the charge is only powered by batteries and the state

# Page 53


WARNING AND ALARMS | PAG. 53

this problem is to discharge the batteries a little until the alarm is resolved (Low
charges, for example) and then perform a maintenance charge so that the inter­
nal cells of the batteries are balanced. For more information, refer to the on-
screen help or to  7.Warning and Alarms.

EMERGENCY MUSHROOM (ALARM #51)

This alarm occurs due to the pressing of the emergency mushroom. To eliminate
this alarm the mushroom must be rearmed. Please note that if the emergency
mushroom has been pressed, it may be due to a safety condition. Check the con­
dition of the machine and check with the operator who has pressed the emergen­
cy mushroom before rearming it. For more information, refer to the on-screen
help or to 7.Warning and Alarms.

DIFFERENTIAL JUMP (ALARM #52)

This alarm is due to the differential switch of the EHR equipment that is running.
This is due to a current drift at the output. Before reassembling the magnetother­
mal output check all the wiring and the tightening torque of the terminals. If all is
correct, it is possible that this drift is occurring in the installation that is feeding
the EHR, so you should check that installation. For more information, refer to the
on-screen help or to  7.Warning and Alarms.

Once the problem is solved, reset the magnetothermal output and then rearm
the differential switch.

LOW BATTERY OPERATING MODE STOP (ALARM #53)

This alarm occurs when any operating mode is working and the state of charge of
the batteries or SoC has decreased by 20%: for safety reasons, the operating
mode is shut down. This alarm occurs when the primary power supply cannot be
activated remotely or it is supplying the installation at its maximum power, ma­
king it impossible to charge the batteries. It is advisable to charge the battery
when this alarm occurs. For more information, refer to the on-screen help or to
7.Warning and Alarms.

This alarm can be related to the previous alarm, "The equipment has been tur­
ned off because one of the phases has been turned off" (Alarm #1), since, if an
immediate shutdown occurs due to one of the inverters being turned off during
its operation, both alarms can occur instantly. To solve the execution of this
alarm, you should refer to the on-screen help or see  7.Warning and Alarms.

A TIME SYNCHRONISATION ERROR HAS OCCURRED (ALARM #4)

This alarm appears when the synchronisation between the inverters is erro­
neous, due to a failure of real-time communications. As a result, the system is­
sues an alarm and shuts the operating mode down. In the vast majority of cases
this alarm runs continuously and it is necessary to perform a complete restart of
the EHR equipment to resolve it, see 5. Starting up the EHR plant. Although it is
advisable to perform the steps indicated in the on-screen help, see 7.Warning
and Alarms.

HIGH INVERTER TEMPERATURE (ALARM #11)

This alarm occurs after the "High inverter temperature" warning. For this reason,
you have to previously deal with the warning by referring to the on-screen help,
please also refer to  7.Warning and Alarms.

OUTPUT OVERLOAD (ALARM #13)

This alarm occurs after the "Output overload" warning. For this reason, you have
to previously deal with the warning by referring to the on-screen help, please also
refer to  7.Warning and Alarms.

LOW VOLTAGE BATTERY (ALARM #38)

This alarm occurs because the BMS of the batteries detects that a cell of the
batteries has a voltage that is lower than acceptable, for this reason the system
shuts the operating mode down. It is worth mentioning that the best way to solve
this problem is to charge the battery, either a fast or a maintenance charge (if a
maintenance charge is performed, the internal cells of the batteries should be
balanced to achieve a better result). For more information, refer to the on-screen
help or to 7.Warning and Alarms.

HIGH VOLTAGE BATTERY (ALARM #39)

This alarm occurs because the BMS of the batteries detects that a cell of the
batteries has a voltage that is higher than acceptable, for this reason the system
shuts the operating mode down. It is worth mentioning that the best way to solve

THE MAXIMUM CONTRACTED POWER HAS BEEN EXCEEDED (ALARM #55)

This alarm occurs when the calendar is enabled. When the calendar is configu­
red, a period of time and a maximum power will be established. When the insta­
llation is supplied with a power higher than that which has been configured, the
mode of operation at that moment will be shut down immediately. For more infor­
mation about configuring the calendar, see Calendar section.

You may wish to refer to the on-screen help for more information, or to  7.Warning
and Alarms.
