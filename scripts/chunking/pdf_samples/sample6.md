SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
CARBON MONOXIDE-POISONOUS
GAS Use generator outdoors, away
from open windows, vents, or doors.
Generator exhaust contains carbon
monoxide - a poisonous gas that can
kill you. You CAN NOT smell or see
this gas. Never use a generator in
enclosed or partially-enclosed spaces.
Generators can produce high levels of
carbon monoxide very quickly.
When you use a portable generator,
remember that you cannot smell or
see carbon monoxide.
Even if you can’t smell exhaust fumes,
you may still be exposed to carbon
monoxide. If you start to feel sick,
dizzy, or weak while using a
generator, get to fresh air RIGHT
AWAY. DO NOT DELAY. The carbon
monoxide from generators can
rapidly lead to full incapacitation and
death.
If you experience serious symptoms,
get medical attention immediately.
Inform medical staff that carbon
monoxide poisoning is suspected. If
you experienced symptoms while
indoors, have someone call the fire
department to determine when it is
safe to re-enter the building.
Never operate the generator in an
explosive atmosphere, near
combustible materials or where
ventilation is not sufficient to carry
away exhaust fumes.
Exhaust fumes can cause serious
injury or death.
NEVER use a generator indoors,

including in homes, garages,
basements, crawl spaces, and other
enclosed or partially-enclosed areas,
even with ventilation. Opening doors
and windows or using fans will not
prevent carbon monoxide build-up in
the home.
Follow the instructions that come
with your generator. Locate the
unit outdoors and away from doors,
windows, and vents that could allow
the carbon monoxide gas to come
indoors.
ONLY run generator outdoors and
away from air intakes.
NEVER run generator inside homes,
garages, sheds, or other
semi-enclosed spaces. These  spaces
can trap poisonous gases EVEN IF
you run a fan or open doors and
windows.
If you start to feel sick, dizzy, or weak
while using the generator, shut if off
and get fresh air RIGHT AWAY. See a
doctor. You may have carbon
monoxide poisoning.
Install battery-operated carbon
monoxide alarms or plug-in carbon
monoxide alarms with battery back-
up in your home, according to the
manufacturer’s installation
instructions.
The carbon monoxide alarms should
be certified to the requirements of
the latest safety standards for carbon
monoxide alarms. (UL 2034, IAS 6-96,
or CSA 6.19.01).
Test your carbon monoxide alarm
frequently and replace dead batteries.

GROUNDING INSTRUCTIONS
This product must be grounded.  If it
should malfunction or breakdown,
grounding provides a path of least
resistance for electric current to
reduce the risk of electric shock.
Improper connection of the equipment-
grounding conductor can result in a risk

of electrocution. Check with a qualified
electrician or service person if you
are in doubt as to whether the unit is
properly grounded.

The ground path should be made with
#8 size wire. Connect the other end of
the wire securely to a suitable ground
source.
The National Electric Code contains
several practical ways in which to
establish a good ground source.
Examples given below illustrate a few
of the ways in which a good ground
source may be established.
A metal underground water pipe
in direct contact with the earth
for at least 10 feet can be used as
a grounding source. If an pipe is
unavailable, an 8 foot length of pipe or
rod may be used as the ground
source.
The pipe should be 3/4 inch trade size
or larger and the outer surface must
be noncorrosive. If a steel or iron rod
is used it should be at least 5/8 inch
diameter and if a nonferrous rod is
used it should be at least 1/2 inch
diameter and be listed as material for
grounding. Drive the rod or pipe to a
depth of 8 feet. If a rock bottom is
encountered less than 4 feet down,
bury the rod or pipe in a trench. All
electrical tools and appliances
operated from this generator, must be
properly grounded by use of a third
wire or be
“Double Insulated”.
It is recommended to:
1. Use electrical devices with 3 prong
power cords.
2. Use an extension cord with a 3 hole
receptacle and a 3 prong plug at the
opposite ends to ensure continuity of
the ground protection from the
generator to appliance.
We strongly recommend that all
applicable federal, state and local
regulations relating to grounding

2

specifications be checked and
followed.

LINE TRANSFER SWITCH
If this generator is used for standby
service, it must have a transfer switch
between the utility power service and
the generator. The transfer switch not
only prevents the utility power from
feeding into the generator, but is also
prevents the generator form feeding
out into the utility company’s lines.
This is intended to protect the
serviceman who may be working on a
damaged line.

THIS INSTALLATION MUST BE DONE BY
A LICENSED ELECTRICIAN AND ALL
LOCAL CODES MUST BE FOLLOWED.

ENGINE OIL
See HONDA Owner’s Manual for
more information.
