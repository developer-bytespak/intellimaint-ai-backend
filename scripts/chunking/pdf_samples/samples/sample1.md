# Introduction


Batteries are an essential part of any standby generator system and some 90% of all generator
failures are due to batteries.

It is therefore vital that batteries are stored, commissioned and maintained as detailed overleaf.
Reference should also be made to the Battery Manufacturer’s leaflet.

Batteries are usually supplied with the generator in ‘dry-charged’ form. In order to commission dry-
charged lead-acid batteries, pre-mixed electrolyte of the correct type and specific gravity must be
added to the cells of the battery.

# Storage


Dry-charged batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place, upright and with the vent caps
securely in place.

Filled and charged batteries must be stored in a cool, dry, well ventilated place. Ensure that the
vent caps are securely screwed down, or pushed home.

Batteries must never be stacked one on top of another and must be protected from the floor by a
wooden pallet or suitably thick cardboard sheet.

Section 4 – Commissioning
Page 4-1

# SECTION 4 - COMMISSIONING


# 4

# Commissioning


Note:
Commissioning is to be undertaken by suitably trained and qualified service personnel
only .

Lead-acid batteries supplied in dry-charged form are commissioned as follows:

## 4.1

## Pre-Commissioning Procedure


1.
Check for any mechanical damage to the battery case or terminals, and ensure that the
battery is clean and dry.

2.
Smear the battery terminals with petroleum jelly to prevent corrosion.

3.
Remove the vent plugs and break any seals (if present), taking care not to damage the plates
or separators. The broken seal will fall into the bottom of the chamber and do no harm.

## 4.2

## Filling with Electrolyte


1.
Fill each cell of the battery with dilute sulphuric acid (electrolyte) of the correct specific gravity
(SG) as shown in Table 6-1, and according to the levels given in Table 8-1. (8.2 litres per
standard 655 battery).

2.
The filling operation must be completed in one operation.

3.
Allow the battery to soak for ten to fifteen minutes. If the electrolyte level has fallen, it should
be restored by adding electrolyte of the correct SG to the levels given in Table 8-1.

4.
After filling, the battery must be placed on a commissioning charge within 1 hour . Charging
must take place before any load is placed on the battery. (Refer to Section 4.4).

Caution:
Failure to give this commissioning charge may impair the charge capacity and life of
the battery.

## 4.3

## Charging


1.
Charge the battery at the current rating given in Table 8-1 for a minimum of four hours in
order to ensure that the acid is sufficiently mixed within the battery. The charging period may
need to be extended if the battery has been in storage.

2.
At the end of the charging process, the electrolyte levels must be checked and restored if
necessary by the addition of electrolyte of the correct SG. The vent caps must then be
replaced.

Note:
Any further topping-up of the electrolyte must be made using distilled or de-ionised
water.

3.
When the generator set is running, check the charge alternator output using an induction
ammeter.

Section 4 – Commissioning

## 4.4

## Fitting the battery to the Generator Set


1.
A battery must not be fitted to a generator set without charge if the SG of the electrolyte has
fallen below 1.240 during storage.

2.
Battery hold-down bolts must be tight but not over tight .

3.
Re-smear the terminals with petroleum jelly, if necessary.

4.
Fit the vents firmly in position and ensure that the battery is clean and dry.

5.
Ensure correct polarity when connecting the battery to the set. Even momentary incorrect
connection can cause damage to the electrical system. Connect the positive generator cable
FIRST, followed by the negative ground.

6.
Terminal connections must be tight but not over tight .

# Maintenance


Note:
Maintenance-free batteries are sealed and do not require the addition of electrolyte.
Some manufacturers of maintenance-free batteries provide an ‘eye’ or some visible
means of telling when the battery is discharged or approaching the end of its useful life.

Batteries require attention at all times, even when not working. A battery will not last if it is
neglected. Maintenance is carried out as follows:

## 5.1

## General


Keep the battery, and the battery area, clean and dry. Ensure that the vent caps are securely
screwed down, or pushed home.

To avoid contamination of the battery, only clean it when the vent plugs are in place.

Keep the battery terminals and connections free from corrosion by lightly coating them with
petroleum jelly.

Check the condition of the starting batteries (see Figure 6-1) every month or 100 hours whichever
occurs first.

WARNING:
THOROUGHLY VENTILATE BATTERY AREA BEFORE WORKING ON THE
BATTERY.
IGNITION OF EXPLOSIVE BATTERY GASES CAN CAUSE SEVERE
PERSONAL INJURY. DO NOT SMOKE WHILE SERVICING BATTERIES, OR
CAUSE SPARKS OR ARCING THAT MAY IGNITE BATTERY GASES.

[TABLE_PLACEHOLDER]

WARNING:
TO PREVENT DANGEROUS ARCING, ALWAYS DISCONNECT THE
NEGATIVE (-) GROUND CABLE FROM THE BATTERY BEFORE WORKING
ON ANY PARTS OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OR THE ENGINE.
DISCHARGE STATIC ELECTRICITY FROM BODY BEFORE TOUCHING
BATTERIES, BY FIRST TOUCHING A GROUNDED METAL SURFACE.

Section 5 – Maintenance

## 5.2

## Cleaning Batteries


WARNING:
ELECTROLYTE IS A DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID THAT IS HARMFUL TO THE
SKIN AND EYES. DO NOT GET THE SUBSTANCE IN YOUR EYES OR
CONTACT WITH SKIN. WEAR GOGGLES, PROTECTIVE RUBBER GLOVES,
AND APRON WHEN SERVICING BATTERIES.

WARNING:
IN CASE OF SKIN CONTACT, IMMEDIATELY WASH AFFECTED AREA
WITH SOAP AND WATER.
IN CASE OF EYE CONTACT, IMMEDIATELY FLOOD EYES WITH LARGE
AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR A MINIMUM OF FIFTEEN MINUTES.
IMMEDIATELY CALL A PHYSICIAN.

Prevent a build up of dirt or corrosion by wiping the batteries with a damp cloth. Use a solution
consisting of 1/4 lb (0.11kg) of baking soda added to 1 quart (0.96 litres) of water to neutralize any
possible acid. Be sure the vent plugs are tight to prevent any cleaning solution from entering the
cells.

After cleaning, ensure the battery and surrounding areas are dry.

After making connections, coat the terminals with a light application of petroleum jelly to retard
corrosion. Keep the battery terminals clean and tight. A loose connection can reduce battery
standby time and cause battery fires.

## 5.3

## Charging


Where generator sets are used infrequently, battery re-charging must take place when the SG
drops below 1.220 (or 1.180 in tropical climates) until the SG in all cells rises and remains constant
for three hours. In all cases where use is infrequent, batteries must be put on a monthly re-charge
schedule to ensure that a fully charged condition is maintained.

Caution:
NEVER allow a battery to become completely flat (fully discharged), or to stand in a
discharged condition, or damage will result.

1.
Remove the vent caps before carrying out charging.

2.
Do not put a filled battery into storage without first giving the battery a commissioning charge.

3.
Batteries must be given a further charge every six months at the normal initial charge rate
until the voltage and SG cease to rise.

4.
At the end of the charging process, the electrolyte levels must be checked and restored, if
necessary, by the addition of electrolyte of the correct SG. The vent caps must then be
replaced.

## 5.4

## Trickle / Boost Charging (Option)


Where a mains-powered battery charger is provided (and switched ON), the battery will
automatically receive a ‘trickle-charge’ to prevent the battery becoming discharged below its
optimum charge level.

During trickle-charging, not all cells in the battery receive the same charge; over a period of
several months this may affect battery performance. It is therefore good practice to give batteries a
regular charge at their full rate to return all cells to full capacity. This is referred to as boost-
charging, or equalise-charging.

If the charger is fitted with a Boost Charge switch, the Boost position should be selected at
intervals detailed by the battery manufacturer (normally around every six months).

Caution:
Batteries should not be left on Boost Charge for extended periods as this will result
in excessive water consumption, gassing, and may impair battery performance.

A Boost Charge not exceeding twice the bench charge rate may be used, providing that:

The electrolyte temperature does not exceed 109°F (43°C).

The battery volts do not reach 15V (for a 12V battery)

If either of these situations should arise, reduce the charge rate to the normal bench rate. For
tropical climates the temperature must not exceed 120°F (49°C).

Note:
The charge period should be extended:

To eight hours if the battery has been in storage for three months or more, at
temperatures in excess of 86°F (30°C), or if humidity is above 80%

To twelve hours if the battery has been in storage for twelve months or more

At the end of the charging process, the electrolyte levels must be checked and restored if
necessary by the addition of electrolyte of the correct SG. The vent caps must then be replaced.

## 6.1

## Checking Electrolyte Level


Caution:
NEVER add tap or well water and NEVER allow the battery electrolyte to drop
below the top of the plates.

Caution:
Do not add water in freezing weather unless the engine will run long enough
(two to three hours) to assure a thorough mixing of water and electrolyte.

Check the level of the electrolyte (acid and water solution) in the batteries at least every month or
100 hours of operation, whichever occurs first. Maintain the electrolyte to the levels indicated in
Table 8-1 by the addition of distilled or de-ionised water only and recharge. Replace the vent plugs
once filling is completed.

If one cell is low, check case for leaks.

Keep the battery case clean and dry. An accumulation of moisture will lead to a more rapid
discharge and battery failure.

Section 6 – Electrolyte Specific Gravity and Temperature

## 6.2

## Checking Specific Gravity


Use a battery hydrometer to check the specific gravity of the electrolyte in each battery cell.

Hold the hydrometer vertical and take the reading. A fully charged battery will have a corrected
specific gravity of 1.260 at 77°F (25°C). Charge the battery if the reading is below 1.215.

Table 6-1
Specific Gravity

Table 6-1 shows the specific gravity (SG) of electrolyte, corrected to 77°F (25°C). Correct the SG
reading for other temperatures by subtracting seven gravity points (0.007) for every 18°F (10°C)
the electrolyte temperature is above 80°F (27 ° C). Apply the correction formula as follows:

1.
For every 18°F (10°C) above 77°F (25°C), subtract 0.007 (7 points)

2.
For every 18°F (10°C) below 77°F (25°C), add 0.007 (7 points)

For example:
if the Specific Gravity at 77°F (25°C) is 1.260,
then the Specific Gravity at 59°F (15°C) is 1.267

Specific Gravity reading
should be
1.260 at 25 ( C
