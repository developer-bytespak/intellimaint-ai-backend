# MiTM Pressure Washers CA2703HDHB1 2017 Pump Assembly Replacement

This guide shows how to remove and replace the entire pump assembly as a whole unit for the Mi-T-M gas pressure washer.

You have to remove the output assembly from the pump in order to replace the pump assembly. This requires removing many tight pipe fittings.

You will need something that is 3” tall to place underneath the pump assembly. This can be a wooden block, brick, etc. This will help  brace the pump while you work on removing the fittings.

The following tools are optional, but can help with disassembly:

* 1/4” socket
* 11/16” wrench
* 3/4” wrench
* 15/16” wrench
* 1” wrench

## 1. Determine the unloader assembly
- '''There are two versions of the unloader assembly: '''
  - First image—earlier pressure washers feature an all-in-one assembly (part 8-0631) that’s easy to replace, but gave users the ability to break the pump.
  - Second image—later models use a tamper-proof, harder to remove unloader (part 8-0656), connected by a series of pipe fittings.
> **Note:** This guide is written for the tamper-proof unloader assembly.
- If you need to remove an all-in-one style unloader, use a large adjustable wrench to unscrew the two large Banjo bolts. This will disconnect the unloader from the pump assembly.

- '''Re-assembly tip:''' note how the washers are stacked when reinstalling the bolts.
- Replace the lock washers with new ones.

## Conclusion

To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.

When you re-connect the fittings, clean off the old thread sealant and apply new thread sealant (tape or pipe dope).
