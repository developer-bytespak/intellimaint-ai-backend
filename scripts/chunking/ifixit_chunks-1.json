[guide|149962|Read how to do that here].\n- Power down your Steam Deck and unplug any cables.\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** If you have a microSD card installed, ***make sure to remove it*** before opening the Steam Deck. If you attempt to remove the back cover with it still installed, [post|744361|it could snap right in half|new_window=true].\n> **Note:** During your repair, it can be helpful at times to lay the Steam Deck face-down into its case to protect the thumbsticks and prevent wobble."

This makes changing screens considerably easier.\n- The back of the iPhone 7 is Aluminum whereas the back of the iPhone 8 is glass to facilitate wireless charging.\n\nStep 17: iPhone X\n- The iPhone X has two battery cells perpendicular to each other.\n\nStep 18: iPhone Xs\n- The iPhone XS has a gold square to the right of the camera bracket.\n\nStep 19: Step 19\n- The iPhone X (Left) and Xs (Right) are extremely similar the only discernible way to tell the difference is to take a look at the back of the display. Look to the right of the camera bracket. The Xs will have a gold square and that is the only discernible difference.\n\nStep 20: iPhone XS Max\n- The Xs Max is just a larger version of the Xs just as the 11 pro has the 11 pro max.\n\nStep 21: iPhone XR\n- Insert wisdom here.\n\nStep 22: iPhone 11\n- Insert wisdom here."

This requires removing many tight pipe fittings.\n\nYou will need something that is 3” tall to place underneath the pump assembly. This can be a wooden block, brick, etc. This will help  brace the pump while you work on removing the fittings.\n\nThe following tools are optional, but can help with disassembly:\n\n* 1/4” socket\n* 11/16” wrench\n* 3/4” wrench\n* 15/16” wrench\n* 1” wrench"

This will disconnect the unloader from the pump assembly.\n\nStep 2: Step 2\n> **Note:** Before you begin, be sure that the engine is powered off and is cool to the touch.\n- Grab the plastic housing at the end of the spark plug wire.\n- Pull firmly to disconnect the wire from the spark plug.\n\nStep 3: Loosen the hose clamp\n- Use a 1/4\" socket or a large flathead screwdriver to loosen the hose clamp near the inlet filter.\n- Slide the hose clamp away from the end of the hose.\n\nStep 4: Disconnect the return hose\n- Wiggle the hose and pull it off of the brass nipple."
