      "content": "# Steam Deck Left Button Board Replacement\n\nUse this guide to replace the left button daughterboard on your Steam Deck LCD.\n\nRemember: follow general [link|https://www.ifixit.com/News/4883/esd-is-not-a-venereal-disease|electrostatic discharge (ESD) safety procedures] while repairing your device.\n\nThese steps only describe how to physically remove and replace your console’s button board. ***You may need additional software tools and calibration procedures*** to get a replacement board to function as intended.\n\n## 1. Prepare your Steam Deck for disassembly\n> ⚠️ **Caution:** Turn on your Steam Deck and allow the battery to discharge below 25% before starting your repairs, as a charged lithium-ion polymer battery can be dangerous if accidentally punctured. > **Note:** As an extra precaution, Valve recommends putting your Steam Deck into ***battery storage mode*** within the BIOS before starting any internal repairs. [guide|149962|Read how to do that here]. - Power down your Steam Deck and unplug any cables. > ⚠️ **Caution:** If you have a microSD card installed, ***make sure to remove it*** before opening the Steam Deck. If you attempt to remove the back cover with it still installed, [post|744361|it could snap right in half|new_window=true]. > **Note:** During your repair, it can be helpful at times to lay the Steam Deck face-down into its case to protect the thumbsticks and prevent wobble. ![Step 1 Image 2859003](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vQyR3PAE4HOMSLAZ.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vQyR3PAE4HOMSLAZ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vQyR3PAE4HOMSLAZ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vQyR3PAE4HOMSLAZ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vQyR3PAE4HOMSLAZ.full --> ![Step 1 Image 2858999](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIKAs5r3P3bY2iTE.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIKAs5r3P3bY2iTE.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIKAs5r3P3bY2iTE.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIKAs5r3P3bY2iTE.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/aIKAs5r3P3bY2iTE.full --> ![Step 1 Image 2903279](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hD1USYJCkAbkluud.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hD1USYJCkAbkluud.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hD1USYJCkAbkluud.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hD1USYJCkAbkluud.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/hD1USYJCkAbkluud.full -->\n\n## 2. Remove the back cover screws\n- Use a Phillips driver to remove the eight screws securing the back cover: - Four coarse thread 9.5 mm-long screws - Four fine thread 5.8 mm-long screws > **Note:** Despite the standards, Phillips screwdrivers can vary in size and shape—two drivers labeled as the same size may fit differently in the same screw.  Use the size that fits the snuggest into the screw head. > **Note:** Throughout this repair, [product|IF145-491|keep track of each screw|new_window=true] and make sure it goes back exactly where it came from to avoid damaging your Steam Deck. ![Step 2 Image 2617672](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bpUGGPG32OkLXnC4.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bpUGGPG32OkLXnC4.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bpUGGPG32OkLXnC4.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bpUGGPG32OkLXnC4.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/bpUGGPG32OkLXnC4.full -->\n\n## 3. Unclip the back cover\n- Insert an opening pick into the thin gap between the back cover and the front shell, along the edge of the right grip. > **Note:** If you're having trouble inserting your pick at the grip seam, try starting at either the top or bottom long edges first, then slide the pick towards the grip. - Pry up on the back cover to release it from the locking clips. ![Step 3 Image 2617602](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6jtVcFtMGa5ZMqcF.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6jtVcFtMGa5ZMqcF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6jtVcFtMGa5ZMqcF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6jtVcFtMGa5ZMqcF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6jtVcFtMGa5ZMqcF.full --> ![Step 3 Image 2617601](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ux5LEj3JfJlkmQMQ.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ux5LEj3JfJlkmQMQ.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ux5LEj3JfJlkmQMQ.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ux5LEj3JfJlkmQMQ.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/Ux5LEj3JfJlkmQMQ.full -->\n\n## 4. Remove the back cover\n> **Note:** Once the clips are disconnected from one edge, the rest disconnect easily. - Grip the back cover at the opening you just created and pull it up and away from the device to unclip the long edges. - Remove the back cover. ![Step 4 Image 2617668](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6IvIWWqEXPTqW1XB.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6IvIWWqEXPTqW1XB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6IvIWWqEXPTqW1XB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6IvIWWqEXPTqW1XB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/6IvIWWqEXPTqW1XB.full --> ![Step 4 Image 2617667](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1FxwYDjIGOAOCZT2.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1FxwYDjIGOAOCZT2.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1FxwYDjIGOAOCZT2.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1FxwYDjIGOAOCZT2.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/1FxwYDjIGOAOCZT2.full --> ![Step 4 Image 2617669](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KpIx4YIAZrDH1b5T.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KpIx4YIAZrDH1b5T.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KpIx4YIAZrDH1b5T.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KpIx4YIAZrDH1b5T.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KpIx4YIAZrDH1b5T.full -->\n\n## 5. Uncover the hidden shield screw\n> **Note:** If you have a [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/l2ABGc6CMQFIytZB.full|refreshed Steam Deck version|new_window=true] with the black motherboard cover, skip this step. - Use a pair of [product|IF145-020|tweezers] to remove the piece of foil tape covering the hidden screw on the board shield. > **Note:** If possible, try not to rip or tear this tape so it can be reused. If necessary, you can fashion a replacement by cutting a piece of aluminum foil tape to fit. ![Step 5 Image 2617665](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WuMbLgtJF5JwQtjF.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WuMbLgtJF5JwQtjF.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WuMbLgtJF5JwQtjF.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WuMbLgtJF5JwQtjF.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/WuMbLgtJF5JwQtjF.full --> ![Step 5 Image 2617664](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I6pEKNGEKEDbNymT.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I6pEKNGEKEDbNymT.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I6pEKNGEKEDbNymT.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I6pEKNGEKEDbNymT.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/I6pEKNGEKEDbNymT.full -->\n\n## 6.
