      "content": "# MiTM Pressure Washers CA2703HDHB1 2017 Pump Assembly Replacement\n\nThis guide shows how to remove and replace the entire pump assembly as a whole unit for the Mi-T-M gas pressure washer.\n\nYou have to remove the output assembly from the pump in order to replace the pump assembly. This requires removing many tight pipe fittings.\n\nYou will need something that is 3” tall to place underneath the pump assembly. This can be a wooden block, brick, etc. This will help  brace the pump while you work on removing the fittings.\n\nThe following tools are optional, but can help with disassembly:\n\n* 1/4” socket * 11/16” wrench * 3/4” wrench * 15/16” wrench * 1” wrench\n\n## 1. Determine the unloader assembly\n- '''There are two versions of the unloader assembly: ''' - First image—earlier pressure washers feature an all-in-one assembly (part 8-0631) that’s easy to replace, but gave users the ability to break the pump. - Second image—later models use a tamper-proof, harder to remove unloader (part 8-0656), connected by a series of pipe fittings. > **Note:** This guide is written for the tamper-proof unloader assembly. - If you need to remove an all-in-one style unloader, use a large adjustable wrench to unscrew the two large Banjo bolts. This will disconnect the unloader from the pump assembly. ![Step 1 Image 1889932](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OZIOd4IdAOsdFZqc.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OZIOd4IdAOsdFZqc.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OZIOd4IdAOsdFZqc.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OZIOd4IdAOsdFZqc.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/OZIOd4IdAOsdFZqc.full --> ![Step 1 Image 1889929](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KMkTxSsf1hVFy5gG.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KMkTxSsf1hVFy5gG.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KMkTxSsf1hVFy5gG.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KMkTxSsf1hVFy5gG.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/KMkTxSsf1hVFy5gG.full --> ![Step 1 Image 1889937](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MDNmxEEaUafnyoAd.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MDNmxEEaUafnyoAd.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MDNmxEEaUafnyoAd.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MDNmxEEaUafnyoAd.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MDNmxEEaUafnyoAd.full -->\n\n## 2. Step 2\n> **Note:** Before you begin, be sure that the engine is powered off and is cool to the touch. - Grab the plastic housing at the end of the spark plug wire. - Pull firmly to disconnect the wire from the spark plug. ![Step 2 Image 2073211](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5UE5GC1VGEKYaSiO.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5UE5GC1VGEKYaSiO.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5UE5GC1VGEKYaSiO.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5UE5GC1VGEKYaSiO.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5UE5GC1VGEKYaSiO.full --> ![Step 2 Image 2073212](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rF2vbhriuFIYKOJB.full) <!-- Image URLs: thumbnail=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rF2vbhriuFIYKOJB.thumbnail, medium=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rF2vbhriuFIYKOJB.medium, large=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rF2vbhriuFIYKOJB.large, original=https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rF2vbhriuFIYKOJB.full -->\n\n## 3.
