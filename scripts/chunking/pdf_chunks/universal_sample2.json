With justification, the number of invoices or days can be changed. The intent is to show evidence that the dealer is able to receive the requested labor rate on a retail basis.\n\nVerification of the posted in-shop door rate is required before the rate change takes effect.\n\nThe intent is that the sponsoring distributor ensures that the dealer’s requested rate is less than or equal to the actual rate billed to customers on a retail basis (also referred to as the posted in-shop door rate).\n\n1) Dealer Steps to Request a Labor Rate\n\nDealers may request a labor rate change one time per calendar year by notifying the distributor in writing. The rate request must include the following:\n\n• Dealer Name\n\n• Dealer Address, City, State, Zip (Postal) Code\n\n• Dealer Code\n\n• Posted In-Shop Door Rate (specify currency)\n\n• Warranty Labor Rate Requested (must not exceed verified posted in-shop door rate)\n\n2) Distributor Door Rate Verification Process\n\nUpon receiving the labor rate request from the dealer, the Distributor Warranty Manager will confirm that the requested rate has been billed on a retail basis to customers, by reviewing up to 10 invoices\n(issued within 90 days of the dealer labor rate request). The intent is to show evidence that the dealer is able to receive the requested labor rate on a retail basis. The invoices must reflect Cummins Power\nGeneration work. If the invoices do not accurately reflect the billable hourly rate requested, the distributor can also verify by reviewing dealer work orders, shop orders, or repair orders, if necessary.\n\nIn any case, the approved warranty labor rate must NOT exceed the verified posted in-shop door rate. The posted in-shop door rate refers to the normal retail rate for Cummins repairs.\nDocuments showing premium rates for specialty vehicles such as Recreational Vehicles, etc., should not be used as supporting evidence for labor rate requests.\n\nGuidelines to make a determination:\n\n• The Distributor Warranty Manager must review the dealer documentation, which must reflect evidence of the requested retail rate.\n\n• If the rates on the documentation are lower than the requested rate, the Distributor Warranty\nManager should ONLY approve the highest retail hourly rate reflected on the documentation.\nExample: If request is $90/hour and invoices show the highest retail rate is $85/hour, the\nDistributor Warranty Manager must only approve $85/hour.",

In addition, the dealer warranty rate may be reset to the previous rate.\n\n6) Exclusions\n\nLabor rate requests are approved one time per calendar year.\n\nDealer labor rates that have been updated during the current calendar year will not be eligible for an additional rate change until the following calendar year.\n\n7) Disclaimer\n\nRegardless of the process outlined herein, Cummins Power Generation reserves the right to set warranty labor rates at its sole discretion.\n\nPlease direct questions and comments to the CPG Factory Administrator.",
