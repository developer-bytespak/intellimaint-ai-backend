Components, instructions or safety standards may appear that do not apply to or are insufficient for the specific equipment you have purchased. In that case you must assess and determine which instructions are valid for your equipment, supplementing them if necessary.

Depending on the grounding sys­ tem to be implemented, a connection must be made to the ground or to the EHR.\nA chassis plate and a grounding plate are included and, depending on the groun­ ding system to be wired, these plates must be bridged or not.\n\nFor a proper connection, one or more grounding rods must be wired. It should be noted that when a “grounding rod” is mentioned, this refers to a physical groun­ ding connection. It is usually done by placing a copper bar (grounding rod) in the ground. But depending on the location of the system, it can also be a copper plate or strip buried in the ground, the water supply grid, or the water pipes of a house.\n\nEHR equipment allows connection with TNS, TT and the IT grounding system.\nListed below are the steps to follow to connect each of the grounding systems.\n\nIdentify the EHR by the appropriate label with its basic reference values, as well as the serial number, the unique identification for each unit:\n\nLifting point\n\nForklift pockets\n\nReinforced rental chassis\n\nAir Inlet\n\nPower electronics\n\nBattery Rack",

Maximum battery charge (kW)\n\nVacuum consumption without ventilation (W)\n\nFan noise (dB)\n\nGeneral working temperature (°C)\n\nUPS function\n\nThe EHR can be used as an offline uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In the event of a grid or power supply failure, the EHR will continue to supply power to the output loads.\n\nThe change of status is less than 20 ms with zero interruption of the output supply, which means there will be no interruptions in power.\n\nHICORE incorporates an operating mode intended exclusively for this function\n(see 5.10 Working modes | UPS mode). It requires no user intervention and will continue to power the output until the EHR power storage runs out. If the primary power supply is detected once again, it will supply power to charge the EHR battery to ensure it is ready for the next power outage.\n\nPower assist\n\nThe Battery Assist (Power Assist) function is automatically activated when necessary, without the user having to take any action.\n\nThe power assist function is activated when the load demand rises above the input limit of the AC source. When activated, the inverters synchronize with the\nAC source and add the power to the incoming power. This feature is useful when a load demand is needed at intervals that the AC source cannot supply.\n\nEach EHR model has a minimum power value that the primary power supply must have for the power assist to work. If it doesn’t, the system will not run properly.\nTherefore, when choosing the primary power supply, note that these vary depending on whether it is an electricity distribution grid or a generator set:\n\nMinimum three-phase current (A)\n4.00\n11.00\n15.00\nMinimum power (kW)\n3.00\n8.00\n10.00",

Do not use flammable solvents when carrying out cleaning tasks; it is recommended that you use aqueous liquids for industrial cleaning.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nBefore performing any operation, shut down the EHR and wait until it cools down.\n\nThe EHR requires a regular storage maintenance load when not in use.

When the emergency mushroom is pressed, this alarm appears with the \"Emergency Mushroom\" alarm, since the emergency mushroom causes a shutdown of the master phase of the equipment and performs an im­ mediate system shutdown. Another cause can be when there is an unsafe condi­ tion for the equipment, for example when there is a very high overload, and the machine shuts down suddenly; in most cases the alarm will appear due to the shutdown and this alarm.\n\nIf this alarm is caused by pressing on the mushroom, disengaging it will suffice, but if this alarm occurs because of any other reason and continues to run conti­ nuously, the system should be reset.
