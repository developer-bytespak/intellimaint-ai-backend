As an authorized warranty repair location, you play a vital role in the delivery of these programs to our customers. We must work together to meet or exceed customer expectations.\n\nCustomers expect Cummins Power Generation and its authorized warranty locations to:\n\n1. Stand behind Cummins Power Generation products.\n\n2. Repair all failures that are a result of defects in material or factory workmanship by Cummins\n\nPower Generation, or arrange for OEM warranty service if component is from another manufacturer.\n\n3. Provide the benefit of the coverage immediately.\n\n4. Treat all customers fairly and consistently.\n\nAs an authorized warranty location, Cummins Power Generation has delegated the authority to you to administer our warranty and extended warranty programs according to the administrative procedures included in this manual. The principles behind these procedures are the following:\n\n• Cummins Power Generation expects high quality repairs to be made to its products, but without over- or under-repair.\n\n• Cummins Power Generation pays to fix all warrantable or covered failures that are the result of defects in material or factory workmanship.\n\n• Cummins Power Generation does not pay for failures that result from customer abuse or neglect. The service location must make sure that the customer understands the corrective action required to avoid future failures resulting from abuse or neglect.\n\nCummins Power Generation delegates this authority only to those locations that administer warranty and extended warranty programs according to these principles and procedures.\n\nThis page is intentionally blank.\n\n1.

Upon delivery you should perform the following:\n\n• Make an accurate count of all items listed on the waybill.\n\n• Carefully inspect for visible damage or signs of improper handling.\n\n• Open crates, cartons, and packages immediately and inspect the contents thoroughly. Concealed damage can occur even if the container appears undamaged. If damage is found, save the packaging and request a Concealed Damage Inspection Report from the transportation company as quickly as possible (within 15 days after delivery).\n\n• Note any damage or shortage on all copies of the waybill (called “making an exception”) and have the driver sign to confirm an exception was made at the time of delivery. It is always the responsibility of the receiver to inspect and note exceptions on all shipments.\n\n## 3.10.2 North America Shipping Damage Recovery\n\nThe Cummins Power Generation Shipping Department may assist in a damage recovery from a shipping company.

      "content": "## Audit Procedure\n\nDistributor compliance audits are conducted at the discretion of Cummins Power Generation.\n\nClaims may be randomly selected for audit on a real-time basis throughout the year. Cummins Power Generation may select claims to be audited at its sole discretion. Appropriate audit procedures are applied to each claim and supporting documentation to confirm compliance with published guidelines and procedures.\n\nAll supporting claim documentation must be available for review during the audit. Minimum Claim Documentation Requirements, defined later in this chapter, apply to all authorized repair locations and are the basis for compliance testing of program administrative procedures and claim submission requirements.\n\nCummins Power Generation Audit Requirements stipulate that original repair documents and accounting records supporting claim submissions must be retained by distributors and all other repair locations for a minimum period of one year after the claim has been paid by Cummins Power Generation.\n\n## 7.2.2\n\n## Audit Report\n\nAudit results are presented in a written report to the distributor and include the following:\n\n• Sample size, dollar value of sample, dollar variance, variance rate percentage, number of error points, and error rate percentage\n\n• A detailed listing of audit exceptions and variances with corresponding claim references\n\n• Audit rating\n\nIf an analysis of audit exceptions and deviations is deemed unsatisfactory, expanded audit tests, including increased sample size, may be performed in specific areas.\n\n7. Claim Audits Effective: 14 December 2015\n\n66 A040W374 (Issue 15) Copyright © 2015 Cummins Inc.\n\nCummins Power Generation retains the right to request reimbursement from distributors for the dollar variance of claims which do not comply with published guidelines and procedures. The amount of the reimbursement may be calculated using samples drawn from the claims population of the review period, with non-compliance rates from the sample being extrapolated over the entire claims population.\n\n## 7.2.3\n\n## Response to Audit Report\n\nUpon request, distributors are required to prepare a written response to the audit report addressing the following issues:\n\n• An implementation plan to improve controls and procedures, thereby preventing future occurrences of the exceptions noted in the audit report\n\n• A timetable for the implementation plan\n\n## 7.2.4\n\n## Follow-Up Audits\n\nIf an unacceptable audit rating is issued to a distributor, or if a distributor’s corrective action plan addressing the weaknesses and/or deficiencies noted in the audit report is unsatisfactory, a follow-up audit will be conducted to ensure implementation of appropriate administrative controls and compliance with claims processing procedures.\n\nService providers or distributors receiving a failing score will be responsible for funding costs associated with re-audit activities.\n\n# 7.3",

      "content": "# Dealer Compliance Audits\n\nCummins Power Generation dealers play an important role in the administration of Cummins Power Generation Warranty and Extended Warranty Programs. The way in which warranty is administered by dealers reflects the business interests of Cummins Power Generation, its distributors, and its dealer organizations. As a result, distributors are responsible for ascertaining the validity and compliance of claims submitted by dealers, fleets, and other customers within their territory.\n\nThe purpose of dealer compliance audits is to ensure that dealers, in their capacity as authorized repair locations, are administering Cummins Power Generation Warranty and Extended Warranty Programs in accordance with the principles and procedures set forth in the Cummins Power Generation Warranty Administration Manual and other published guidelines.\n\nCummins Power Generation dealers are unable to file claims directly to Cummins Power Generation. Distributors are responsible for ascertaining the validity and compliance of claims submitted by dealers, fleets, and other customers within their territory.\n\nIf a dealer claim is present in the audit sample, the distributor must acquire all supporting claim documentation from the dealer to satisfy the audit requirements. If the dealer is unable to supply all supporting claim documentation, or if the claim is deemed non-compliant, the results will be reflected in the overall distributor audit score.\n\n## 7.3.1\n\n## Dealer Claim Documentation\n\nDealers may be granted authority by distributors to make Cummins Power Generation warranty repairs. All repair locations are expected to meet the same standards of documentation for claims.\n\nDistributors are responsible for ensuring that dealer's claim documentation is available upon request. If original records are retained by the repair location, an exact copy of the original documents, such as repair orders, technicians documentation, and time cards are adequate for distributor records.\n\nInvoices that show only the Cummins Power Generation-billed portion of a repair are NOT considered original repair records and do not meet Cummins Power Generation's minimum claim documentation requirements.\n\n67 A040W374 (Issue 15) Copyright © 2015 Cummins Inc.\n\n1 On some PGBU products, there is more than one way to check engine run time. Service Technicians are advised to use most accurate meter available. When all meters are similar, use the most beneficial to the customer e.g. for a 3000 hour coverage, if Genset hour meter = 3006, and controls = 2908, use 2908 for claim filing.\n\n[TABLE_PLACEHOLDER]\n\n# 7.4\n\n# Minimum Claim Documentation Requirements\n\n## 7.4.1",

Supporting documentation is important to Cummins Power Generation and its repair locations because it documents, substantiates, and supports the determination of warranty and extended warranty program coverage liability.\n\nCummins Power Generation retains the right to review a Distributor's program administration system and to request modification of procedures and controls to prevent the submission of non-compliant claims. In addition, Cummins Power Generation may also request reimbursement from distributors for non-compliant claims.

Identify the failed part and progressive damage, if any\n\n2. Support the occurrence of the failure\n\n3. Justify the repair performed\n\nWhen computerized repair documentation systems are used, technicians must input the failure analysis and progressive damage directly into the computer record or record the failure analysis and progressive damage on an input document. In either case, the source of the input must be traceable and identifiable.\n\nThe narrative section of repair orders and claims should be filled out per the following requirements.\n\nTo support audit requirements, the technician must record their identification number or name with their input if no systematic controls are in place to identify the technician who entered the computer record.\n\n1. Defects unrelated to the customer's complaint detected during the troubleshooting and repair of\n\nthe complaint should be noted in the cause section (e.g., troubleshooting a miss and visually detecting a leaking water pump).\n\n2. On repairs involving progressive damage, document the root cause (implied by the failure code)\n\nplus the damage details (which must be free-form entered in the cause section).\n\n3. Measurements such as various before and after readings, fault codes, etc., should be included\n\nas appropriate in the cause section.\n\n4. Location of the failed item should be entered where appropriate (i.e., #3 injector). If an item from\n\nmultiple locations failed (i.e., #1, #3, and #5 injectors), enter one of the locations with the failure code, generate the narrative, and manually add the other locations to the cause section of the work order/claim.\n\n5. Any non-SRT time (99-999) on the work order needs to be fully documented (for each non-\n\nstandard procedure performed) in the non-SRT comments section of the work order. When the work is logged, the technician number should be logged against description of the work to support audit requirements.\n\nTo determine that the narrative is sufficient, ask “Can I, based on the information on the claim, explain what was done in the course of the repair and why to the customer?” If the answer is yes, the narrative is sufficient. If not, additional information should be included.\n\n69 A040W374 (Issue 15) Copyright © 2015 Cummins Inc.\n\n## 7.4.6\n\n## Correction of the Failure",

The description must contain enough detail to support all work operations.\n\nThe documentation must be in the technician's own handwriting unless a computerized documentation system is used. The normal place to record this information is on the repair order.\n\nWhere a computerized repair documentation system is in place, each technician should input the record of the work performed. Controls should be in place to allow identification of the technician entering the repair data.\n\nAll claimed SRT and non-SRT (99-999) repair times must be supported in the repair description or the computer SRT record. The technician must keep a separate time record of the non-SRT labor. A detailed account of all non-SRT operations must be made by the technician indicating times on and off of non-SRT operations.\n\nIf systemic controls are not in place to identify the technician that entered the repair data, the technician must log their number or name against the entry.\n\nAll repair labor operations not supported by the failure should be documented by the technician. This includes, but is not limited to, items removed to gain access to perform the repair, as well as unusual occurrences such as broken or seized fasteners.\n\nDocumentation must be in the technician's handwriting, unless a computerized documentations system is used. If a computerized system is used, the technician may enter the information directly into the system in a free text field, provided they log their technician number against the entry.\n\n## 7.4.6.2 Labor Records\n\nTime card entries for in-shop repairs must be recorded by a mechanized device, including repair starting and ending times.\n\nFor site repairs, the repair starting and ending times may be recorded by the technician with a handwritten entry, provided that the time leaving from and returning to the shop is recorded by a mechanized time entry.\n\nThe time record must include the month and date as well as the time of day. When a mechanized time entry is not recorded at the appropriate time, the adjusted entry must be traceable to input and must be approved by the shop supervisor or foreman.\n\nThe following information must be entered on all time records prior to starting the work:\n\n1. Technician's name or identification number\n\n2. Repair order number\n\nAll labor charged to the job must be traceable through the labor accounting records to one of the following:\n\n• Claimed labor\n\n• Customer billed labor\n\n• Non-productive or internal labor cost account",

Likewise, no record should be made of a parts transaction unless the transaction actually occurred.\n\n## 7.4.6.4 Field Service Reports\n\nAny site work that results in claimed expenses incurred outside the repair shop must be fully supported by the technician's record, including:\n\n1. The total service activity for the trip (This must include the time they left the shop, arrived at the\n\njob site, left the job site, and arrived back at the shop or next repair site.)\n\n2. The total expenses for the trip\n\n3. The allocation of all trip expenses to each individual job worked on during the trip\n\nTravel labor must be shown separately from the repair labor.

Beginning and ending trip odometer readings are required and must be indicated on the field service report.\n\nLodging or miscellaneous travel expenses must be supported by receipts. Reimbursement for dinner and lodging is allowed when travel time plus SRT time exceeds 10 hours for one trip. Air travel reimbursement includes the actual airfare cost in addition to the mechanic's actual wage for the actual travel time.\n\nComputerized Field Service Reports — if mobile or wireless technician input devices are utilized, the location must be able to demonstrate that the technician entered the repair details, including travel time and mileage. When the wireless technician inputs the information directly into the electronic work order, the technician must log their identification number against the entry.\n\n## 7.4.6.5 Other Claimables\n\nItems claimed in the Other Claimables section of the claim must be supported by the appropriate documentation. Receipts must be retained for subcontracted services or outside purchases pertaining to the repair. Any consumables claimed must be supported by the technician's documentation.\n\n## 7.4.6.6 Test Results\n\nAll recorded test results used to diagnose a failure or verify a repair must be retained and available for review as part of the original claim documentation.",
