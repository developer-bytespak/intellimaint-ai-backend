# Original Source Files

These are the original NestJS boilerplate files that were in the root `src/` directory.

The new structure has been created according to the architecture.md specification.
You can safely delete this backup folder once you've verified the new structure works.

## Original Files
- app.controller.spec.ts
- app.controller.ts
- app.module.ts (replaced by new modular structure)
- app.service.ts
- main.ts (replaced by enhanced version in gateway/src/main.ts)
