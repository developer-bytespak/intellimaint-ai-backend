The warnings in this manual, and on tags and decals affixed to the unit are not all-inclusive. If using a procedure, work method or operating technique the manufacturer does not specifically recommend, ensure that it is safe for personnel. Also make sure the procedure, work method or operating technique used does not render the generator unsafe.\n\nDespite the safe design of this generator, operating this equipment imprudently, neglecting its mainte- nance or being careless can cause possible injury or death.

The operator also must comply with all such codes, standards, regulations and product Installation Manual guidelines.\n\u2022 The engine exhaust fumes contain carbon monoxide, which can be DEADLY. This dangerous gas, if breathed in sufficient concentrations, can cause unconsciousness or even death. DO NOT alter or add to the exhaust system or do anything that might render the system unsafe or in noncompliance with applicable codes and standards.\n\u2022 Install a carbon monoxide alarm indoors, according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions/recommendations.\n\u2022 Adequate, unobstructed flow of cooling and ventilating air is critical for correct generator operation. Do not alter the installation or permit even partial blockage of ventilation provisions, as this can seriously affect safe operation of the generator. The generator MUST be installed and operated outdoors only.\n\u2022 Keep hands, feet, clothing, etc. away from drive belts, fans, and other moving or hot parts. Never remove any drive belt or fan guard while the unit is operating.\n\u2022 When working on this equipment, remain alert at all times. Never work on the equipment when physically or men- tally fatigued.\n\u2022 Inspect the generator regularly, and contact the nearest Dealer for parts needing repair or replacement.\n\u2022 Before performing any maintenance on the generator, remove the control panel fuse and disconnect the Nega- tive (-) battery cable to prevent accidental startup. When disconnecting battery cables always remove the NEGA-\nTIVE (-) cable first. When reconnecting the cables, connect the POSITIVE (+) cable first.\n\u2022 Never use the generator or any of its parts as a step.

      "content": "\u2022 All generators covered by this manual produce dangerous electrical voltages that can cause fatal electrical shock. Utility power delivers extremely high and dangerous voltages to the transfer switch, as does the standby generator when it is in operation. Avoid contact with bare wires, terminals, connections, etc. while the unit is run- ning. Ensure all appropriate covers, guards and barriers are in place, secured and/or locked before operating the generator. If work must be done around an operating unit, stand on an insulated, dry surface to reduce potential shock hazard.\n\u2022 Do not handle any kind of electrical device while standing in water, while barefoot, or while hands or feet are wet.\n\u2022 The generator may crank and start at any time when utility power is lost. When this occurs, load circuits are transferred to the STANDBY (generator) power source. Before working on the generator, always move the Main\nCircuit Breaker switch on the control panel down to the OFF (Open) position, press the OFF key on the control panel keypad, remove the 7.5 amp fuse, and disconnect the battery negative cable (black) from the battery neg- ative (-) terminal.\n\u2022 In case of accident caused by electric shock, immediately shut down the source of electrical power. If this is not possible, attempt to free the victim from the live conductor. AVOID DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE VICTIM. Use a nonconducting implement, such as a dry rope or board, to free the victim from the live conductor. If the victim is unconscious, apply first aid and get immediate medical help.\n\u2022 Never wear jewelry when working on this equipment. Jewelry can conduct electricity resulting in electric shock, or may get caught in moving parts resulting in injury.\n\n\u2022 For fire safety, the generator must be installed and maintained properly. Installation MUST always comply with applicable codes, standards, laws, regulations and product Installation Manual guidelines. Adhere strictly to local, state, and national electrical and building codes. Comply with regulations of the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration (OSHA). Also, ensure that the generator is installed in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and recommendations. Following proper installation, do nothing that might alter a safe installation and render the unit in noncompliance with the aforementioned codes, standards, laws and regulations.\n\u2022 Keep a fire extinguisher near the generator at all times. Extinguishers rated \u201cABC\u201d by the National Fire Protection\nAssociation are appropriate for use on the standby generator. Keep the extinguisher properly charged and be familiar with its use. Consult the local fire department with any questions pertaining to fire extinguishers.\n\n\u2022 Do not smoke around the generator. Wipe up any fuel or oil spills immediately. Ensure that no combustible mate- rials are left in the generator compartment, or on or near the generator as FIRE or EXPLOSION may result. Keep the area surrounding the generator clean and free from debris.\n\nOwner\u2019s Manual for Stationary Diesel Generators\n\nOwner\u2019s Manual for Stationary Diesel Generators",

      "content": "The following procedures require special tools and skills. Contact a Generac Dealer or an authorized service provider to perform these tasks.\n\nUpon power up, the controller goes through a system self test which checks for the presence of utility voltage on the\nDC circuits. This is done to prevent damage if the installer mistakenly connects AC utility power sense wires into the\nDC terminal block. If utility voltage is detected, the controller displays a warning message and locks out the generator, thereby preventing damage to the controller. Remove power to the controller to clear this warning.\n\nUtility voltage must be turned on and present at the N1 and N2 terminals inside the generator control panel for this test to be performed and pass.\n\nBefore starting, complete the following:\n\n1.\nVerify that the generator is OFF. A red LED on the control pad illuminates to confirm that the system is in the OFF\n\n2.\nVerify that the Main Circuit Breaker switch on the generator control panel is in the OFF (Open) position.\n\n3.\nTurn off all circuit breakers/electrical loads that will be powered by the generator.\n\n4.\nCheck the fuel level, coolant level, and engine lubricating oil level. See Subsections 5.7.2, 5.7.4, and 5.7.6, respectively.\n\nDuring initial start up only, the generator may exceed the normal number of start attempts and experience an \u201cover crank\u201d fault. This is due to accumulated air in the fuel system during installation. Reset the control board and restart up to two more times, if necessary.
