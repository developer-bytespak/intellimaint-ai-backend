In line with our policy of continuous product improvement, we reserve the right to change the information contained within this manual without notice.\n\nThis Operator Instruction Manual has been designed to help you operate and maintain your electrical generator set correctly.\nWe recommend that the operator should take the time to read this manual. Certain tasks may require work to be completed by specifically trained technicians, an operator should only attempt a task detailed for an operator to complete.\n\nThis generator set is one of a family of heavy duty industrial generator sets designed to be ready to run when it arrives. Years of diesel generator set experience has gone into the set to produce a quality source of electrical power that is efficient and reliable.\n\nAlways ensure that maintenance, adjustments and repairs are done by personnel who are authorised to do the work and have been properly trained. Maintenance and repairs should also be carried out at regular intervals using genuine parts, this will prolong the life of the generator set. The manufacturer is not liable for any defects or claims due to the user\u2019s improper installation, maintenance or use, or for any products which have been modified in any way from the state in which they were sold.\nAll generator sets should only be operated by those required to do so and therefore be safely kept away from non authorised use.\n\nSome photographs or illustrations in this manual show details or attachments that may be different from your generator set.\nThese images are for illustrative purposes only. If you have any questions regarding your generator set, please contact your local\nDealer for the latest available information.\n\nEvery generator set is uniquely defined by a model number and serial number indicated on a rating plate generally affixed to the alternator housing (See Section 3.1). This information is required when ordering spare parts or when service or warranty work is required.\n\nThe generator set is designed to be safe when used in the correct manner. Responsibility for safety, however, rests with the personnel who use the set. Before performing any procedure or operating technique, it is the user\u2019s responsibility to ensure that it is safe to do so.\n\nWarning :\n\nI\nRead and understand all safety precautions and warnings before operating the generator set.\n\nI\nFailure to follow the instructions, procedures and safety precautions in this manual may increase the possibility of\n\nI\nNever start the generator set unless it is safe to do so.\n\nI\nDo not attempt to operate the generator set with a known unsafe condition.",

This label contains the information needed to identify the generator set and its operating characteristics. This information includes, but is not limited to, the model and serial numbers, output characteristics such as voltage, phase and frequency, output rating in kVA and kW and rating type (basis of the rating). The model and serial numbers uniquely identify the generator set.\n\nThe diesel engine powering the generator set has been chosen for its reliability and the fact that it has been specifically designed for powering generator sets. The engine is of the heavy duty industrial type with 4 stroke compression ignition and is fitted with all accessories to provide a reliable power supply.\n\nThe engine electrical system is either 12 or 24 volts DC depending on the size of the set.\n\nThe engine cooling system comprises of a radiator, a high capacity pusher fan and a thermostat. The main AC alternator has its own internal fan to cool the alternator components.\n\nThe output electrical power is produced by an alternator fine tuned to the output of this generator set.\n\nThe engine and alternator are coupled together and mounted on a heavy duty steel base frame. The base frame incorporates an integrated or polyethylene fuel tank except for the largest sets (approximately 1,000 kVA and above).\n\nThe generator set is fitted with vibration isolators which are designed to reduce engine vibration being transmitted to the foundation on which the generator set is mounted. These isolators are fitted between the engine/alternator feet and the base frame. Alternatively, on 4008, 4012 and 4016 powered models the engine/alternator is rigidly mounted on the base frame and the vibration isolators are supplied loose to be fitted between the base frame and the foundation.\n\nAn exhaust silencer is provided loose for installation with the generator sets. The silencer and exhaust system reduce the noise emission from the engine and can direct exhaust gases to safe outlets.\n\nOne of several types of control systems and panels is fitted to control the operation and output of the generator set and to protect the set from possible malfunctions. Section 5 of this manual provides detailed information on these systems and will aid in identification of the control system fitted on the generator set.\n\nTo protect the alternator, a suitably rated circuit breaker selected for the generator set model and output rating is supplied mounted in a steel enclosure.",

It provides a rigid support to prevent deflection and vibration. Typically the foundation should be from 150 mm to 200 mm (6 to 8 inches) deep and at least 150 mm (6 inches) wider and longer than the generator set. The ground or floor below the foundation should be properly prepared and should be structurally suited to carry the combined weight of the foundation pad and the generator set. (If the generator set is to be installed above the ground floor the building structure must be able to support the weight of the generator set, fuel storage and accessories.) Relevant building codes should be consulted and complied with. If the floor is wet from time to time, such as in a boiler room, the pad should be raised above the floor. This will provide a dry footing for the generator set and for those who connect, service or operate it. It will also minimise corrosive action on the base frame.\n\nTo minimise engine vibrations being transmitted to the building, the generator set is fitted with vibration isolators. On small and medium sized generator sets these isolators are fitted between the engine/alternator feet and the base frame. This allows the frame to be rigidly bolted to the foundation. On larger generator sets the coupled engine/alternator is rigidly attached to the base frame and the vibration isolators are supplied loose for fitting between the base frame and the foundation. In all cases the sets should be securely bolted to the ground (either through the base frame or through the vibration isolators) to prevent\n\nVibration isolation is also required between the generator set and its external connections. This is achieved by the use of flexible connections in the fuel lines, exhaust system, radiator air discharge duct, electrical conduit for control and power cables and other externally connected support systems.\n\nLong term storage can have detrimental effects on both the engine and alternator. These effects can be minimised by properly preparing and storing the generator set.\n\nI\nBefore storage of the generator set please perform all required maintenance as recommended.

All of the adjustable setpoints are associated with a specific level of security required to make an adjustment to the parameter. The passwords only affect changing setpoints within the control panel.\n\nIf a parameter is displayed with a padlock but no security level identification number next to it, the parameter cannot be changed from the PowerWizard display and the Dealer must be contacted. Level 1 and 2 passwords are disabled when installed. Level 1 and 2 passwords are user level passwords and can be used if desired.\n\nThe PowerWizard 2.1 also has a SCADA password, which can be used to secure remote communications.\n\nTo view the security menu:\n\nAt the top of the security menu the current security level is displayed. Within the security menu are the following options:\n\nDROP TO MINIMUM LEVEL \u2013 used to return the current security level to the lowest level set-up. Highlight and press Enter to drop to minimum security level. If no Level 1 or 2 passwords are set-up the minimum level will be 2. If a Level 2 password is set-up, the minimum level will be 1 and if a Level 1 password is set-up the minimum level will be 0.\n\nENTER LEVEL 1 OR 2 \u2013 used to enter Level 1 or 2 passwords. Highlight and press Enter to proceed to the password entry screen.\nPasswords can be entered using the cursor keys. In PowerWizard, Level 1 and 2 passwords must be different. An entered password is compared against the stored Level 1 and 2 passwords, if the password is correct the PowerWizard will go to the corresponding security level.\n\nENTER LEVEL 3 \u2013 used to obtain Level 3 access. The Level 3 security password is reserved for critical setpoints that should only be changed by a skilled operative. As such you must contact your Dealer if you require a change associated with a Level 3 password.\n\nCHANGING LEVEL 1 PASSWORD \u2013 used to set-up, change or disable a Level 1 password. In order to use this feature the control must be at current security Level 1 or higher. Highlight and press Enter to proceed to the password entry screen.

While the engine is running the batteries are charged by the engine driven battery charging alternator.\n\nThe switch-mode charger is an automatic battery charger, switch mode chargers with Auto Boost will automatically enter an increased charging voltage state (boost) when the voltage drops below a preset voltage level. After the auto boost cycle the charger will switch back to its normal \u2018float\u2019 voltage.

The red button is a combined trip lamp and stop button. The green button is a run lamp and manual start push button.\n\nTo operate the pump manually, ensure the red push button is in the \u201cON\u201d position (pulled out). Press and hold the green push button to manually run the pump. The pump will only run in the manual mode while the green button is held in.\n\nTo operate the pump in automatic mode, ensure that the red push button is in the \u201cON\u201d position (pulled out). The pump will start running automatically when the fuel level is low and will illuminate the green run lamp. When the tank is full, the pump is turned off and the green lamp is extinguished.\n\nThe red lamp will illuminate if there has been an electrical overload.\n\nCare must be taken to ensure that the pump is primed with fuel prior to operation to lubricate the seals.

For operating conditions lower than \u221210\u00b0 C (14\u00b0 F), consult your local FG Wilson dealer.\n\n\u2022\t If the engine will start, operate the engine until a minimum operating temperature of 80\u00b0 C (176\u00b0 F) is achieved. Achieving operating temperature will help prevent the intake valves and exhaust valves from sticking.\n\n\u2022\t The cooling system and the lubrication system for the engine do not lose heat immediately upon shutdown. Retention of heat means that an engine can be shut down for a time and the engine can remain able to start readily.\n\n\u2022\t Install the correct specification of engine lubricant before the beginning of cold weather.\n\n\u2022\t Check all rubber parts (hoses, fan drive belts, and so on) weekly.\n\n\u2022\t Check all electrical wiring and connections for any fraying or damaged insulation.\n\n\u2022\t Keep all batteries fully charged and warm.\n\n\u2022\t Fill the fuel tank at the end of each shift.\n\n\u2022\t Drain the water from the fuel system. Refer to this Operation and Maintenance Manual, \u201cFuel System Primary Filter/Water\nSeparator - Drain\u201d.\n\n\u2022\t Check the air cleaners and the air intake daily. Check the air intake more often when you operate in snow.\n\nI\nPersonal injury or property damage can result from alcohol or starting fluids. Alcohol or starting fluids are highly flammable and toxic and if improperly stored could result in injury or property damage.\n\nI\nDo not use aerosol types of starting aids such as ether.
