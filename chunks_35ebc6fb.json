This generator is designed and intended only for supplying electrical power for operating compatible electrical lighting, appliances, tools and motor loads, and is not intended for any other purpose. It is important that you read and understand these instructions thoroughly before attempting to start or operate this equipment.\nSave these original instructions for future reference.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nThe manufacturer cannot possibly anticipate every possible circumstance that might involve a hazard. The warnings in this manual and the tags and decals affixed to the unit are therefore not all-inclusive. If you use a procedure, work method or operating technique that the manufacturer does not specifically recommend you must satisfy yourself that it is safe for you and others. You must also make sure that the procedure work method or operating technique that you choose does not render the generator unsafe.",
