Do not install the appliance at less than 2.20 m above the ground.\n\nA cut-o\ufb00 valve and three-piece coupling must be \ufb01tted on the gas supply.\nt\u0001\nCheck that there is an adequate mains gas supply. In particular: make sure that the t\u0001 gas mains pressure, with the appliance operating, is set to 20 mbar (204 mm H 2 O) with an admissible range of 17 mbar to 25 mbar (G20 natural gas supply).\nHook the appliance up as shown in the installation wiring diagram (see Figure t\u0001\n3.11 \u2192 24), and make sure the power supply is rated at 230 V 1N - 50Hz.

A two-pole switch is one which opens both the phase and the neutral contacts . Thus both contacts will be open when the switch is opened.\nt\u0001\nIt is obligatory to equip the installation with a room thermostat connected to the appliance as shown in the installation wiring diagram (see Figure 3.11 \u2192 24).\nLocate the thermostat (or its sensor) around 1.5 m o\ufb00 the \ufb02oor, shielded from draughts, direct sunlight, direct heat sources (lamps, the appliance\u2019s hot air output, etc.) and preferably NOT on an external wall , as this will compromise its tempera- ture reading and hence the operation of the installation.
