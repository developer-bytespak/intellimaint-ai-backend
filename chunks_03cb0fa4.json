Should the engine be operated in conditions at a greater inclination, there is a risk of insufficient lubrication or suction of engine oil from the air filter.\n\n4.1 Starting\n\nBefore starting the generator, check that:\n\n- the engine stop switch is in position \u201cON\u201d (Fig. 2 Ref.\n- the fuel tap lever is in position \u201cON\u201d (Fig. 2 Ref. 11).\nIf the engine is cold, turn the start lever to the right before trying to start (Fig. 2 Ref. 15)\n( if the engine is hot, the start lever need not be turned to the right ).\nProceed by resolutely pulling the self-winding cord\n(Fig. 2 Ref. 16) to start running the engine.\nRepeat the operation if the engine does not start after the first attempt.\nAs soon as the engine has started, return the start lever to its original position.\n\nTo prevent damage to the self-winding cord of the engine, never release it abruptly after having pulled it out fully, but guide it until complete rewinding.\n\nThe generator engine has been calibrated, in idle, to\n3120 rpm equal to 52.5 Hz, as the engine stabilises at about 3000 rpm equal to 50Hz with a load. For this reason, the accelerator lever must never shift for any reason, since the output voltage, frequency and power values of the generator would be compromised.\n\nThe available power is as indicated on the adhesive label carrying the technical characteristics (Fig.A).\n\nThe sum of absorption of all the utilities connected to the generator must never exceed the continuous power value of the generator.\n\n4.2 Portection\n\nThe generator is equipped with several protections and warning signals which safeguard it against malfunctioning and improper use.

The centre of gravity of the generator corresponds to about the centre of its geometrical volume.\n\nTrolley:\n\nA two-wheel trolley is available to transport the generators of the EA series.\nFigure 4 illustrates an assembled trolley and the components\n\n[\n9]\n\nGB\n\nTo assemble the trolley proceed as follows:\n- Anchor the wheel axle to the chassis base using the special U-bolts (Fig. 4 Ref. 1)\n- Fit the wheels to the hubs and lock them with the plastic pins (Fig. 4 Ref. 2)\n- Fix the lifting handlebars (Fig. 4 Ref. 3) to the chassis anchoring them with the U-bolts provided.\n\nOn terrestrial in inclination, with the purpose to avoid the spontaneous march of the car to always use corks on both the wheels.\n\n\u2022 The MASE generators and all their components are guaranteed free of defects and are covered by the guarantee for a period of 2 year from the date of\n\n\u2022 Not covered by the guarantee are: failed observance of the installation regulations, damage caused by natural disasters, accidents, defects of the electrical system including the load to which the generator is connected, negligence, improper use or abuse by the operator and damage caused by repairs carried out by unqualified\n\n\u2022 Repairs that cannot be carried out at the place of installation can be carried out at MASE laboratories or at authorised workshops. Transport expenses will be borne by the Customer.",
