Careful planning must be exercised to ensure that adequate ventilation will be available during\n\nCooling systems can range in complexity from the simplest and most common \u201cunit mounted radiator\u201d to the most elaborate, remote mounted radiator, heat exchanger or heat recovery system. It would be inconceivable to properly cover all possible cooling system applications in a guide of this type. For that reason, only unit mounted radiator cooling systems will be described within. Please consult your local General Power LTD representative for design, application and installation assistance for all cooling system applications other than unit mounted radiator cooling.\n\nInstallation considerations for unit mounted radiator cooling systems:\nPrevailing wind: should be a key factor in deciding which direction to discharge the cooling air that will be exhausted out through the unit mounted radiator.\nWind pressure may reduce the amount of air the engine mounted cooling fan can discharge through the unit mounted radiator, causing poor performance or overheating. Consider which direction the wind is usually out of during the hottest days of the year, when the cooling system will require the maximum amount of cooling airflow\n\nNoise: The fans required to move air through a unit mounted radiator\n\ncooling system will produce a fair amount of noise. Consider positioning the radiator exhaust in a direction less subject to objectionable noise levels.\n\nHot air discharge : At times, the cooling air discharged through a unit mounted radiator cooling system can reach levels that could damage shrubs, bushes and plantings. This is of particular a concern if the unit will be operated for extended periods of time during high ambient temperature periods. Choose the placement direction accordingly.\n\nRecirculation of cooling air: The most common cause of unit overheating is cooling air recirculation. When hot air that\u2019s discharged through the radiator is allowed to re-circulate back into the\n\n[\n41]\n\n[\n42]\n\n[\n43]\n\nGeneral Power Limited | Genset Installation Guide\n\ncooling air intake means and through the radiator again, the cooling air can exceed the temperature capabilities of the cooling system causing overheating.
