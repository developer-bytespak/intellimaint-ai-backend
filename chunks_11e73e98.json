When using the generator exhaust system gets very hot. This may cause fire or explosion of these materials.\n- Be sure to follow cleanliness and good lighting in the work area. Clutter and poor lighting may cause an injury.\n- Do not let the presence of unauthorized persons, children or animals when working with generator. If necessary, make sure to fencing the working area.\n\n- The generator produces electricity that may lead to an electric shock while neglecting compliance regulations.\n- In the high humidity level conditions generator exploit is prohibited. Keep the generator in a dry place only.\n- Avoid direct contact with grounded surfaces (pipes, radiators, etc.).\n- Do not allow moisture in the generator. The water inside the device increases the risk of an electric shock.\n- Be careful when working with power cables. Immediately replace it in case of damage, as damaged wire increases the risk of electric shock.\n- All connecting the generator to the network must be made by certified electrician in accordance with all electrical rules and regulations.\n- Connect the generator to the protective ground before operation.\n- Do not connect or disconnect a generator to electricity consumers, which are placed in water on a wet or damp soil.\n- Do not touch parts of the generator under voltage.\n- Connect the generator to those customers only which meet the electrical characteristics and the rated power of the generator.\n- Store all electrical equipment dry and clean. Wires with damaged or spoiled insulation should be replaced. You should also replace worn, damaged or rusty\n\nPersonal safety\n- Be careful. Do not operate the generator, if you are tired, under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Inattention may cause a serious injury.\n- Do not wear loose clothing or jewelry when working. Long hair, jewelry or loose clothing may get into the moving parts of the generator and cause an injury.\n- Avoid inadvertent start. Make sure to set the switch to Off when you turn off the generator.",

The generator battery has a voltage of 12V and if the voltage is lower, you should perform battery charging with the help of an external charger.\n\nTo avoid discharging the battery, it is recommended to run the generator at least once a month for 30 minutes. If the generator is not used for a long time, please disconnect the battery from the terminals. The battery that comes with the generator does not require additional maintenance and filling of electrolyte.\n\nIf you do not plan to use the generator for a long time, we recommend:\n- Drain the fuel from the tank.\n- Drain the oil from the engine.\n- Pull the manual starter until you feel light resistance so that the intake and exhaust valves are closed.\n- Remove the negative terminal of the battery for the electric start models.\n- Clean generator from dirt and dust.\n\nWhen starting the generator after long storage, follow all procedures in reverse\n\nStorage room has to be dry and free from dust deposits. Storage room also has to be locked away from children\n\nTo prevent environment damage generator and battery should be separated from ordinary waste.
