It requires no user intervention and will continue to power the output until the EHR power storage runs out. If the primary power supply is detected once again, it will supply power to charge the EHR battery to ensure it is ready for the next power outage.\n\nPower assist\n\nThe Battery Assist (Power Assist) function is automatically activated when necessary, without the user having to take any action.\n\nThe power assist function is activated when the load demand rises above the input limit of the AC source. When activated, the inverters synchronize with the\nAC source and add the power to the incoming power. This feature is useful when a load demand is needed at intervals that the AC source cannot supply.\n\nEach EHR model has a minimum power value that the primary power supply must have for the power assist to work. If it doesn\u2019t, the system will not run properly.\nTherefore, when choosing the primary power supply, note that these vary depending on whether it is an electricity distribution grid or a generator set:\n\nMinimum three-phase current (A)\n4.00\n11.00\n15.00\n3.00\n8.00\n10.00\n\nThe Power Assist (PEAK SAVING) function in combination with a generator set is limited to these generator set powers and in order to ensure correct use and avoid oscillations in the genset, it is recommended to perform it on 90% of the capacity of the generator set.\nIf the genset power is lower than recommended, HICORE will display an on-screen warning indicating that the generator set capacity is less than the",

To achieve this function, the user must in\u00ad dicate the percentage (%) of energy that he or she wants to feed through the grid, since the rest of the energy will be provided by the battery.\n\nOnce this configuration is made, the system will adapt by feeding the load pre\u00ad sent at the output, with the proportion chosen by the user. This mode of opera\u00ad tion is useful to take advantage of solar energy, since on sunny days with the usual demand for energy, the load present at the output can be fed with a propor\u00ad tion of generator set or grid and the rest will be provided by solar energy (if it is greater than the demand, it will charge the batteries and if it is lower, the battery will provide the missing power). When the maximum threshold of supply power, configured by the user, is exceeded, the input will be limited to that value and the rest of the energy will be provided by the battery.\n\nTo execute this mode of operation it is necessary to insert the percentage (%) of energy contributed by the grid and then press \u201c START \u201d.

Communication with the inverter can fail for several rea\u00ad sons, including:\n\n- False contacts in the DC distribution of the inverter in question,\n\neither due to the \"battery switch\" or incorrect tightening torques on the terminals.\n\n- Poor connection of the communication cables between the\n\ninverters and the L1 inverter to the Cerbo GX, due to a worn RJ45 connector or a broken.\n\n- One of the inverters is defective and has stopped working due to\n\ninternal causes.\n\nThis warning occurs when the battery voltage begins to decrease below a given threshold; this warning does not give rise to any problems as when the SoC is less than 20% a shutdown occurs, and the safety margins are therefore adequa\u00ad\n\nIf this warning does appear, it is telling the user that the battery is running low.\nFor more information, see 7. Warning and alarms.\n\nThis warning occurs when a high inversion is being made, close to the limits pre\u00ad sented by the EHR. It is directly related to the temperature warning, since when an overload warning occurs and the ambient temperature is high, the system tends to increase its internal temperature and produces a temperature warning.\nIf it occurs the other way round, the behaviour is similar: when a temperature warning occurs the system tends to worsen the performance and the EHR increa\u00ad ses the inversion power causing an overload warning. For more information on nominal inversion power values as a function of ambient temperature, see 3.3.\nTechnical characteristics.\n\nThe activation of this warning stems from the overload alarm. With more or less time depending on the power that is being inverted and the ambient temperature at that moment.",
